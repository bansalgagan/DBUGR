Great BOLD

After

Astrofile

is
useless

Metago
wants
us
to
complain
to
Google

I
think
they
should
spend
the
time
to
make
this
work
again
since
other
file
managers
such
as
ES
File
Explorer
seemed
to
have
it
figured
out

Gud BOLD
It

Clunky BOLD
but BOLD
effective BOLD
. BOLD
Works
really
well

but
not
very

Does

I BOLD
've BOLD
used BOLD
this BOLD

found BOLD
it BOLD
to BOLD
be BOLD
slow BOLD
and BOLD
cumbersome BOLD
However
it
may
have
been
my
hardware
that
was
old

Trying
it
now

we

OPTIONS BOLD
There
is
no

Why BOLD
change BOLD
what BOLD
worked BOLD
Still
sort
of
useful
but
removing
the
ability

was
the
feature
that

NEVER
have
been
removed

please
return
it

Was BOLD
great BOLD
.. BOLD
but BOLD
After
the
update

I
ca

Not BOLD

Depends

I
guess
.
On
my
"
old

HTC
,
the
last

wo
n't
allow

That

Broken BOLD
by BOLD
KitKat BOLD
Was
a
fantastic
app
.
Did
everything
I
wanted
from
a
file
manager
.
Then
came
the
KitKat
update
from
Android
which
prevents
Google
play
apps
from
writing
to
SD
memory
.
KK
ruined
this
and
many
other
apps
.
Only
way
to
fix
is
if
phone
is
rooted
and
warranty
voided
on
my
new
phone
.
Had
to
go
back
to
the
builtin
file
manager

If
the

can
find
a
way

around
this

I
have

I

This

now
it
seams

much
junk

thrown
in

the

I
got

either

no

they
are
just
so
watered
down
that
it

Best BOLD
to BOLD
me BOLD
I
've
come
across
many
apps

the
time
but
ASTRO

me
the
most
.
A

enhancing
your

Great
app
for
file
management
!

Was BOLD
good BOLD
before BOLD
, BOLD
now BOLD
it BOLD
's BOLD
great BOLD
. BOLD
Older
versions
were
quite
good
,
but
constant
development
and
refinement
of
features
has
turned
this
into
one
of
the
truly
exceptional
android
applications
.

Grt
app
but
no
advertisement
plzz
its
sucks
....

I BOLD
want BOLD
updates BOLD
This
is
the
best
file
manager
ever
I
use

it
was
awesome
to
use
.

Kkkkk BOLD
Bakwas

Ca BOLD

replace BOLD

I
still
ca
n't
believe
after
all
these
years
,
Astro
still
ca
n't
do
something
as
simple
as
"
replace
file
"
when
you
want
to
copy/move
a
file
to
a
folder
that
already
has
a
file
with
the
same
name
.

File BOLD
move BOLD
, BOLD
rename BOLD
, BOLD
copy BOLD
option BOLD
removed BOLD
Since
last
update
I
am
not
able
move
any
file
from
one
folder
to
other
.
even
I
m
not
getting
rename
option
so
that
I
can
rename
any
file
name
..
Pls
fix
this
issue
asap
..

limited BOLD
the

wo
n't
allow
you
to
write
to
the

They
give
a

request
so
you
can
complain
.
The
write
is
still
enabled

This

should
be
able
to
write
there
since
everything

Thier

This
was
a

why

you

Put

I

Sadly BOLD
moving BOLD

Astro
was
great
until
I
got
kit
Kat
and
could
n't
use
it
to
manage
files
on
my
removable
sd
card
.
Even
after
rooting
and
sdfix
it
did
n't
allow
file
management

Moving
to
another

manager
sadly
.

Arggg BOLD
I
ca
n't
believe
it
.
It
will
not
open
my
Box
offline
files
when
I
'm
not
on

net

When
I
am
on
the
net
and
I
edited
a
text
file
with
Astro
that
was
previously
edited
with
Jota
and/or
notepad
,
the
formatting
is
destroyed
when
I
open
the
text
file
in
notepad
.
All
the
carriage
returns
are
removed
,
piling
all
the
text
together
.
The
format
looked
fine
in
the
Astro
editor
,
but
was
trashed
in
notepad
.
Restoring
from
backup
and
removing
the
program
.
Just
configured
ES
File
Explorer
to
access
my
Box
and
it
edits
the
file
just
fine
and
formatting
stays
intact
.
However
,
ESF
will
not
open
an
offline
file
when
I
'm
not
connected
to
the
net

Sigh
and
arggg
.
Why
ca
n't
they
get
this
right
???
Asana
and
Ziplist
work
fine
when
offline
and
sync
up
when
connected
.
Those
apps
are
wonderful
by
the
way
,
get
them
and
learn

em

It
's
ok

This
is
just

the

Gud

I BOLD
used BOLD
to BOLD
love BOLD
it BOLD
This
app
used
to
be
great
,
but
I
hate
the
new
update
.
It
took
away
all
the
quick
action
features
I
used
.

Nice BOLD
Easy
to
open
all
files

New BOLD
version BOLD
blows BOLD
Extremely
less
intuitive
.
Full
featured
toolbar
at
the
top
is
no
longer
there
.
Where
is
the
multi
select
function
?
Long
press
results
in
a
"
select
all
"
after
second
selection
.
So
stupid
.
You
really
ruined
a
good
thing
.

Good

Ashokraja BOLD
So
nice

Astro BOLD
This
is
a
very
use
full

I
had
to
reinstall
the
app
for
dropbox
to
show
up
again
.

Great BOLD
I
've
used
it
on
multiple
devices
,
for
quite
a
while
,
and
have
been
very
impressed
.
Updated
regularly
.

Awesome BOLD
file BOLD
editor BOLD
and BOLD
manager BOLD
but BOLD
.. BOLD
Everything
about
this
file
manager
is
awesome
and
fast
except
when
I
'm
trying
to
upload
.
When
I
tap
the
file
of
my
video
from
YouTube
,
it
does
n't
work
it
just
closes
.
When
I
used
a
different
file
manager
,
it
worked
on
the
same
file
.
Other
than
that
great
overall
file
manager
.

Awesome BOLD
Awesome
app
to
have

Super

Like BOLD
astro BOLD
I
like
this
.,
its
so
easy
to
use
.

Uninstall BOLD
this BOLD
worst BOLD
app BOLD
I
used
to
love
this
app
,
but
after
few
upgrades
it
started
to
hang
so
much
that
I
had
to
unstall
it
and
switched
to
es
file
explorer
.
ES
file
explorer
is
the
best
replacement
for
astro
.
:)

Good

Lame BOLD
At
first
it
worked
but
then
the
few
days
it
just
crashes
.

Fantastic BOLD
Does
everything
you
need
from
a
file
manager
and
more
.

Change BOLD

sake BOLD

I
do
n't
see
any
positive
things
you

done

Very
nice

The BOLD

SD BOLD

is BOLD
missing BOLD
in BOLD
the BOLD
new BOLD
update BOLD
. BOLD
It
used
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
functions
of
this
app
,
but
it
seems
it
is
no
more
present
.
Please
take
a
look
into
it
.

R

it
hardly
works
as
opposed
to
my
expectations

Prctica BOLD
! BOLD
Muy
buena
App
,
pero
la
nueva
interface
no
es
tan
fluida
como
la
anterior

las

estan
posicionadas

en
lugares
opuestos
de
la

En

Great BOLD
job BOLD
The
new
layout
looks
incredible
.

Get BOLD
ES BOLD
file BOLD
explorer BOLD
instead BOLD
This
is
so-so
.
ES
file
explorer
has
no
adds
,
can
browse
apk
files
,
backs
up
EVERY
apk
on
my
phone
,
has
tons
of
themes
,
lets
me
delete
locations
if
I
want
to
,
and
has
better
view
settings
.
I
cannot
see
using
this
as
my
only
file
manager
.
It
has
one
advantage
though
-
it
works
in
multi-window
.
So
that
is
the
only
reason
I
have
it
.
Try
ES
file
explorer
first
and
see
if
you
like
it
better
.
By
the
way
,
astro
was
my
first
file
manager
almost
two
years
ago
.
I
jumped
ship
and
am
so
glad
I
did
.

Goog

What
happened
?
I
used
to
be
able
to
select
a
file
and
chose
an
app
to
open
it
with
and
it
worked
great
.
Now
my
only
options
when
I
select
are
to
copy
it

trash
it
,
which
are
things
I
do
n't
want
to
do

Amazing BOLD

Less

Come

There

Now
it

Changing

nothing
to

these

and
despite
the
likelihood
that
the
change
is
a
reflection

priorities

this
is
the
kind
of

You

life BOLD
saver BOLD
I
had
downloaded
some
videos
and
for
some
reason
they
were
put
on
sd0
,
not
on
the
8
gb
sdext
card
.
I
did
n't
have
enough
space
left
to
download
any
of
the
new
apps
I
wanted
,
and
I
could
n't
email
the
video
files
elsewhere
.
This
app
removed
that
nightmare
.
Just
copy
to
the
sd
ext
card
,
and
now
I
have
~
900mb
free
.
Still
hard
to
believe
there
is
n't
any
native
functionality
to
do
this
,
but
in
lieu
of
that
,
this
app
is
a
real
life
saver
.

I
really
like
it
and
much
prefer
it
to
my
phones
ordenery
file
manager
but
I
would
like
it
if
you
took
back
some
of
the
things
you
could
do
with
to
older
versions
for
example
I
was
trying
to
mod
minecraft
pe
but
altho
you
can
back
up
apks
you
cant
view
the
files
so
in
the
end
you
cant
mod
it
so
if
you
bring
back
the
old
tools
i
would
be
very
happy
and
will
give
it
a
5
star
thank
you

Network BOLD

The
old

are

Is

Not BOLD
so BOLD
good BOLD
This
used
to
be
a
very
good
app
but
recent
updates
have
made
it
hard

use

removed
most
of
the
functions
that
it
used
to
be
so
good
at
,
i
.
e
.
Moving
files
and
looking
at
cloud
storage

These
functions
have
either
been
removed
or
so
well
hidden
they
ca
n't
be
found
.
Had
supported
this
app
by
buying
the
pro
key
but
that
seems
like
a
waste
now

Very BOLD
great BOLD
app BOLD
It
is
a

The

For

it

So

With

moving

Obamanotbad BOLD

ipg BOLD
I
like
this

My
main
issue
with
this
app
:
I
prefer
to
have
my
icons
in
list
form

small
sized
.
The
fact
that
I
have
to
do
this
for
each

every
folder
is
frustrating
,
redundant
and
annoying

I
hope

this
"
problem

Why BOLD
ca BOLD
n't BOLD
I BOLD
move BOLD

anymore BOLD
The
only
reason
I
got
the

was
to

great BOLD
, BOLD
new BOLD
update BOLD
ruins BOLD
the BOLD
experience BOLD
I
've
used
this
app
for
3+
years
,
and
loved
its
menu
options
for
quick
file
management
.
With
the
latest
update
,
the
"
cleaner
"
look
(
for
beginner
users
,
iPhone-style
?
who
knows
)
is
a
disaster
...
first
,
the
multiple
options
that
populated
on
a
tap-hold
are
gone
,
and
the
"
menu
"
button
to
get
to
them
*
does
n't
work
*
.
I
literally
ca
n't
do
now
what
I
used
the
app
for
90%
of
the
time
.
Other
functions
that
used
to
be
top
level
are
now
hidden
behind
multiple
drawer
taps
.
Shame
,
looks
like
I
'm
going

New BOLD
Update BOLD
It
used
to
be
One
of
the
best
file
manager
app
but
after
the
last
update
it
does
n't
give
me
an
option
to
move
my
files
to
external
sd
card
anymore
....
To
move
it
One
needs
to
copy
files
first
n
then
paste
it
from
inernal
to
external
card
or
vice
versa
,
then
again
One
will
hv
to
go
to
delete
from
the
other

.
Also
On
the
top
right
corner
when
I
click
to

nothing

up

please
fix
it

I
will
rate
it
five

it

of
No
Use

This

There BOLD
are BOLD
problems BOLD
now BOLD
! BOLD
This
ago
used
to
be
really
great
and
intuitive
,
but
now
it
looks
like
an
application
from
android
gingerbread
.
Of
you
can
go
back
to
the
design
a
couple
updates
so
,
then
this
is
a
keeper
,
if
not
then
I
'm
just
going
to
have
to
uninstall
updates
and
live
with
three
same
version
for
the
rest
of
my
tablet
's
life
.

Was BOLD
the BOLD
best BOLD
! BOLD
If
its
not
broke
do
n't
fix
it
Why
would
you
change
everything
around
after
almost
2
years
of
perfection
?
At
least
give
us
the
option
of
using
the
old
one
so
I
'll
have
to
look
for
a
new
one
I
do
not

this
new
one

Used

about
2

Omg BOLD

what BOLD
it BOLD

App
failed

saying
there

even
though

storage

It
's
a
mystery
why
app
is
so
highly
rated

Lost BOLD
functionality BOLD
... BOLD
Before
this
update
,
I
could
move

copy

select

delete

Now
the
"

nothing

I
have
to
move
things
from
1
directory

another
by
copying

then
deleting
from
the
one
I
copied
from

If
you
can
tell

I

doing

if
you
'll
fix

Best BOLD
version BOLD
yet BOLD
I
've
used
Astro
since
2.3
and
it
's
consistently
got
better
.
The
latest
makeover
looks
clean
and
fresh
,
while
preserving
great
functionality
.

Missing BOLD
the BOLD
old BOLD
Astro BOLD
Earlier
it
was
so
easy
to
move
and
copy
stuff
from
sd
card
to
internal
memory
or
vice-versa
.
But
now
it
bloody
complicated
.
Even
if
i
open
any
directory
(
sd
card
ir
internal
memory
)
it
always
opens
the
internal
memory
.
If
you
do
n't
fix
this
problem
,
then
this
app
is
in
DANGER
!!

Where BOLD
'd BOLD
it BOLD
go BOLD
?! BOLD
With
the
newest
update
the
extract
here
button
menu
was
removed
so
you
can
only
delete

copy
it

How

The

Why BOLD
did BOLD
you BOLD
change BOLD
this BOLD
app BOLD
? BOLD
Every
time
I
open
Astro
,
it
asks
me
to
log
in
.
Do
n't
have
one
;
do
n't
need
one
.
And
now
I
find
out
I
ca
n't
even
delete
a
file
without
logging
in
.
This
used
to
be
my
go
to
app
but
not
any
more

Why BOLD
did BOLD
ASTRO BOLD
take BOLD
my BOLD
clouds BOLD
away BOLD
? BOLD
And BOLD
how BOLD
do BOLD
I BOLD
get BOLD
them BOLD
back BOLD
? BOLD
I
used
to
love
this
app
,
but
the
new
version
is
terrible
.
My
Dropbox
,
Google
Drive
,
and
Box
locations
suddenly
disappeared
,
and
I
ca
n't
figure
out
how
to
get
them
back
.
In
fact
,
I
ca
n't
figure
out
how
to
add
ANY
locations
(
I
also
lost
an
ftp
server
)
.
Adding
locations
used
to
be
trivially
easy
but
now
the
feature
seems
to
be
either
hidden
in
some
secondary
menu
or
non-existent
.
For
some
reason
ASTRO
decided
that
my
SkyDrive
was
cool
,
so
I
still
have
access
to
that
one
.
Used
to
be
five
stars
,
but
I
have
to
downgrade
to
a
generous
two
until
I
figure
this
one
out
(
which
I
really
should
n't
have
to
do
)
.

Used BOLD
to BOLD
love BOLD
it BOLD
, BOLD
now BOLD
harder BOLD

move BOLD
files BOLD
& BOLD
I BOLD
ca BOLD
n't BOLD
find BOLD
my BOLD
Dropbox BOLD
! BOLD
I
really
dislike
the
new
interface
.
Previous
versions
had
a
very
intuitive
interface
.
I
was
able
to
easily
add
a
link
to
my
Dropbox
account
.
In
addition
,
the
latest
version
also
does
n't
show
icons
(
or
a
list
)
for
common
actions
aside
from
copying
&
deleting
.
You
now
have
to
click
on
the
"
more
"
icon
,
to
get
a
"
MOVE
"
option
.
I
do
a
LOT
of
file
moving
(
downloads
to
final
folders
)
.
I
hope
this
is
fixed
soon
,
or
I
will
be
looking
for
another
file
manager
for
my
tablet
&
my
phone

the

some

I

Now

giving

Fantastic

Design BOLD
Approach BOLD
Design
shift
is
good
,
but
I
'm
a
bit
confused
as
to
your
drawer
approach
,
and
why
you
did
n't
include
Tools
as
a
grouped
column
similar
to
Locations
,
Bookmarks
etc
.
Defeats
the
purpose
of
the
drawer
.
Also
,
the
app
is
way
too
white
.
It
be
great
if
you
infuse
your
own
colors
and
make
it
material
in
design
.

What BOLD
happenned BOLD
?????? BOLD
90%
of
functionality
down
the
drain
with
this
last
version
?!?!?!!!?!?!?!

Astro BOLD
This
is
one
of
the
best
file
manager
I
used

Getting BOLD
slower BOLD
Used
to
be
fast
,
but
it
takes
too
long
to
access
my
sd
card

Do
n't
have
the
same
problem
with
other
file
managers
.

Great BOLD
App BOLD
I
only
wish
you
could
still
create
folders
.
That
was
one
of
the
best
features
of
this
app
.
Please
bring
it
back

Stopped BOLD

no

What
gives

Deletion BOLD
is BOLD
gone BOLD
What
happened
?
Suddenly
I
no
longer
have
the
ability
to
delete
files
.
Has
this
moved
to
the
paid
version
?
If
so
I
will
be
looking
for
another
file
manager
.

Nice

Usefull

Preferred BOLD
previous BOLD
UI BOLD
I
use
this
app
all
the
time
but
the
previous
UI
was
clean
and
easy
to
use
.
The
latest
UI
update
has
hidden
options
behind
menus
so
has
increased
the
clicks
needed
to
carry
out
tasks
.
This
is
a
not
an
improvement
in
usability
.

WOW BOLD
The
one
major
issue
I
've
always
had
with
Astro
is
the
lag
with
every
function
,
but
since
the
latest
update
this
app
runs
faster
than
even
desktop
file
browsers
!
The
new
layout
makes
sense
,
it
's
eye
pleasing
and
simple
.
The
developers
have
really
outdone
themselves
and
all
competition
.
Just
good
on
you
,
developers
!

Fantastic BOLD

Great

WHAT BOLD
HAPPENED BOLD
?? BOLD
Since
the
new
update
,
I
have
decided
to
QUIT
using
my
one-time
FAVORITE
file
utility
.
Why
such
a
STUPID
"
facelift
"
,
when
all
you
did
was
cause
the
user
to
use
extra
menus
to
accomplish
what
was
once
quiet
simple
?
I
know
it
's
hard
to
be
considered
"
relevant
"
and
"
bleeding
edge
"
...
but
how
about
giving
your
long-time
supporters
the
option
?
Just
MY
thoughts
,
anyway
...
so
sad
.

Music BOLD
files BOLD
play BOLD
at BOLD
the BOLD
same BOLD
time BOLD
? BOLD
I
ca
n't
play
many
music
files
at
the
same
time
by
selecting
all
then
open
them
.
Please
add
this
function
,
it
will
be
5
stars
.

is
clean
finds
almost
anything
(
yet
to
find
a
free
file
manager
to
view
and
access
.
apk
files
)
But
the
main
issue
and
reason
for
me
downloading
this
is
it
refuses
to
move
files
from
internal
storage
to
external
sd
card
.
As
a
file
LOCATER
its
great
for
moving
files
just
meh
.

Nice BOLD
. BOLD
It
can
be
slow
at
times

and
sometimes
be
unreliable

but
,
it
is
still
an
OK
application

There

Cant

Idiots
who

read
through

We
did

start

just
yesterday
.
Long-pressing
on
a
file
and
tapping
the
"
more
"
menu
icon
brought
up
nothing
,
which
is
why
we
wrote
what
we
did
in
our
reviews

Visually
,
the
new

is
great

Functionally
,
it
sucks

I
ca
n't

Beware BOLD
I
contacted
you
recently
because
my
antivirus
program
flagged
your
app
as
suspicious
.
You
assured
me
that
everything
was
ok
.
Today
I
picked
up
my
phone
and
there
is
an
LARGE
ad
on
my
screen
for
something
called
Asian
Date
.
I
traced
the
origin
of
the
ad
back
to
your
app
.
Are
you
insane
?
I
am
a
married
man
.
What
do
you
think
would
have
happened
if
my
wife
had
seen
that
before
me
?
Your
app
is
useful
and
always
worked
well
for
me
.
However
,
I
am
uninstalling
it
today
and
will
post
this
on
the
google
play
store
.

today
it

I
traced
this

deleted
the

everything
is
back

The

Virus BOLD
This
has
an
ad
ware
Trojan
virus
attached
to
it
!!
Do
not
load
it
!!

I BOLD
had BOLD
a BOLD
commercial BOLD
appear BOLD
over BOLD
everything BOLD
on BOLD
my BOLD
screen BOLD
. BOLD
It
was
caused
by
this
app
's
process
.
Took
me
a
while
but
after
killing
processes
one
by
one
,
this
was
the
culprit
.
Besides
appgratis
version
stopped
working
so
disappointed
with
that
.
Everything
is
on
auto
update
.
Does
the
developer
think
everyone
reads
the
text
of
every
app
before
every
update
?
Common
,
epic
fail
.

It BOLD
works BOLD
Works
well
.
Hopefully
the
updates
will
work

Disappointed BOLD
.... BOLD
I
'm
a
appgratis
user
,
I
cannot
read
all
the
time
what
the
new
update
has
,
my
apps
are
updated
automatically
,
now
I
've
got
my
phone
full
of
stupid
graphics
and
designs
that
I
hate
,
just
because
you
released
an
update
that
was
not
capable
of
keeping
the
advantages
of
having
appgratis
!
It
's
really
disappointing
,
I
'm
uninstalling
immediately
!
!!

Trojan BOLD
My
antiviruses
freaked
out
with
the
new
update
.
Got
trojan
warning
and
malware
warnings
.
Uninstalled
.
Do
n't
really
like
getting
screwed
by
ppl
.
Too
bad
cause
this
app
was
very
useful
for
me
and
I
really
liked
it
but
what
my
antiviruses
say
goes
.
I
pay
them
to
protect
me
so
listen
.
Fix
it
and
ill
install
it
again
once
it
returns
on
my
"
daily
free
app
"
app
.

Be BOLD
careful BOLD
My
antivirus
software
said
this
contains
malicious
adware
.

Malware BOLD
According
to
my
Lookout
Premium
security
this
app
is
malware
.
First
time
this
happens
so
I
believed
my
security
software
and
now
this
app
does
n't
uninstall
!

. BOLD
.

Malware BOLD
Random
banner
ads
started
poping
up
after
the
latest
update

Malware BOLD
Multiple
scanners
flagged
latest
update
as
malware
.

Trojan BOLD
Malware
advised
that
this
is
a
trojan
.
Uninstalled

Does BOLD
what BOLD
it BOLD
says BOLD
It
works
as
promised
but
it
seems
unfair
to
offer
a
performance
update
and
deny
it
to
appgratis
users
.

Trojan BOLD
I
guess
other
users
were
right
about
the
intrusive
permissions
.
Uninstalled
as
soon
as
it
was
flagged
as
a
Trojan
!

Crashing BOLD
This

crashes
every
time
I
open

No
idea
why

it
's
only
that
app
that
makes
it

Other
than
that

it
does

Pocket-answer/dialing BOLD

I
drove
a
good

nuts
with
this

Before

could
hear

the
app
would
answer
it
if
ANYTHING
touched

the

a

ANYTHING

No

Unnecessary BOLD
permissions BOLD
To
the
guy
that
thinks
ALL
apps
require
all
these
permissions
,
you
probably
have
malware
.
There
is
no
reason
for
this
app
to
need
GPS
location
or
permissions
to
record
audio
.
You
're
allowing
the
developer
to
have
full
access
to
your
phone
for
really
nothing
.
You
could
probably
code
this
action
with
Tasker
.
Uninstall
it
or
better
yet
do
n't
install
to
begin
with
.

App BOLD
permissions BOLD
are BOLD
very BOLD
suspicious BOLD
. BOLD
This
is
a
"
sponsored
"
app
in
AppGratis
so
they
plan
to
make
money
.
Just
not
sure
how
recording
phone
calls
and
spying
on
everything
about
my
phone
is
supposed
to
do
that
.

GARBAGE
!
I
ca
n't
write
a
txt
without
asking
if
I
want
to
play
Poker
!!

Lots BOLD
of BOLD
Dubious BOLD
Permissions BOLD
Air
Call-Accept
purports
to
let
you
answer
calls
in
a
hands-free
way
,
and
reply
with
an
SMS
should
you
reject
them
.
That
's
all
it
does
.
So
why
does
it
want
to
read
your
call
logs
,
your
SMS
messages
,
your
Web
bookmarks
&
history
,
and
even
what
apps
are
running
!?
In
addition
,
it
also
wants
to
know
your
approximate
&
precise
location
,
and
the
ability
to
directly
call
phone
numbers
!
These
permissions
are
in
no
way
necessary
for
its
declared
purpose
and
,
since
it
also
accesses
the
Internet
&
opens
a
gateway
for
you
to
receive
push
messages
,
it
pretty
much
have
full
control
of
your
phone
.
I
would
be
very
careful
with
this
app
or
better
still
stay
away
from
it
.
(
People
claiming
EVERY
app
asks
for
the
same
permissions
,
are
you
just
ignorant
or
dumb
or
both
?
Next
time
compare
similar
apps
like
Smart
Call
Accept
before
spewing
nonsense
.

I

I

I

Its BOLD
ok BOLD
To
all
those
people
worried
about
it
asking
for
those
permissions
,
EVERY
app
u
have
ever
downloaded
asks
for
all
those
same
permissions
.
So
if
your
really
that
worried
about
it
u
should
just
get
rid
of
your
phone
.
Now
back
to
this
,
my
only
problem
with
it
is
it
does
n't
turn
my

phone
on

I
have
it
set
to
turn
it
on
in
the
settings
and
it
wo

it

Please
fix
that

Thank

Tested
it
several

it
just
was
n't
responding

with
one

releasing

Unreliable BOLD
and BOLD
getting BOLD
spam BOLD
notifications BOLD
Ads
are
one
thing
and
I
understand
developers
need
to
make
money
.
But
spam
notifications
are
unacceptable
.
Period
.
Plus
it
did
n't
work
consistently
anyway
,
and
seemed
to
prevent
me
from
answering
my
phone
at
all
,
sometimes
.
So
,
uninstalling
.
