All the other apps you\'d have to enter that day every time you logged on. Also, I\'ve been using this app since late August, and it\'s so accurate we\'re already pregnant!! Definitely recommend! :):):)"

Thank goodness I saved my data before I changed this month\'s start date, or I wouldn\'t have been able to get back a year\'s worth of data. But it still deletes past start-end dates when you change the current start date. Makes it hard to calculate if my cycle\'s number of days is changing. Frustrating. I\'ve used this app for two years, hoping this issue would be fixed. Gonna start looking for another app..."

It\'s always been nearly 100% accurate for me, as long as I make sure to enter information correctly. I love that I can add notes to specific days, which helps me document medical details. I\'m also happy that I can change the colors. I keep mine dark/black which helps me feel more discrete if I need to open the app where prying eyes wander. Totally recommend this app."

Ive never had a problem up until I decided to upgrade phones.. of course when I downloaded the newest version and tried to use my SD backup it gives an error and lately it gives me a crash error even when I don\'t have the app open. I almost wish I could revert to the older version. I\'ve also noticed my pill alarm doesn\'t take me to the app,  wish it did,  or add \'took pill\' when tapped."

  text: "Could do better.\tIt starts great but... I hated when switching phones having to manually re-enter my history. I want to save info for easy transfer between devices. Sync with Google sign-in. App crashes every time I clear it from task manager which freezes phone. I want to save in app my doctor\'s contact info, for easier communication, set reminders to pick up/fill prescriptions, and have an easier method of taking notes over just a blank notepad. It could be like what my doctor reviews so I\'m ready for each visit."

Still I don\'t really think that\'s necessary for a tracker app. Also, there is no other change in that update - my sister downloaded this app a few days ago and the app had lots of features like mucus levels - and it wasn\'t even my days x, just the regular one. When I updated mine nothing was changed at all!"

I dont know why pink is the reigning theme for period calculators. This app wins. Deftly avoids cartoon bunnies, furry animals, growing or wilting flowers. Period app+female=User is *not* 8 years old. I would like something other than baby pepto Barbie pink. This app allowed custom colors - and a widget that isnt too frou frou.  Great custom options, works well."

That would be great, but it\'s just not correct! It needs a way to tell it you\'re pregnant so that it doesn\'t average that 9 month break in with your regular cycle. I have been using it for years & don\'t want to delete my info just to set it straight again. Please fix & I would give it a full 5 stars."

I am currently expecting and this app has a lot to do with it. I have done my research and the my ovulation date according to this app is the same as what it is according to my doctor. The color coded calendar is extremely helpful, and the alarms/notifications you can activate are helpful too. I will definitely keep this app around."

This is not 2009 where people were just happy to have functioning android apps anymore."

The only down side is that it can get useless once you are pregnant.  Hopefully there is a way where you can input a \"pregnant\" option so it can give tips and helpful information throughout your pregnancy."

I expected it to adjust to my cycle length and it\'s not doing a good job of that. It lacks a little bit if you are charting with fertility in mind too... but that might be a bit more than you can really do well in an app I don\'t know... :) there\'s my critical review :) I pop my info into the app but then chart it out on my paper every few days to get the big picture of where I\'m at."

Took a pregnancy test at 1:30am the next day and it was positive! I was LESS than 4 weeks when I found out! YA! I always tracked when my fiance and I had sex and was able to also figure out my pretty little (14 month old) baby girls conception date - the weekend of March 10th - 12th 2012! My little sweetie was born December 8th, 2012! Thanks for this awesome app! It rocks!"

I had to start from scratch each time and  was unpleasantly surprised when I got my period unexpectedly, or was overprepared days before it was due. If they could ensure that all my could be uploaded by logging in with my email address or a logon, this app would be great."

My boyfriend laughs at me for tracking when we have sex but in case I get pregnant, it\'ll help determine my due date and that is Awesome to have on hand! Also, I don\'t have a regular cycle. I have a period about every 6-9 weeks and it\'s nice to NOT be worried about why I\'m not having a cycle when I expect (because I never carry a calendar)Plus I like to rub it in his face if we haven\'t been active for a while lol ;)"

Now it has totally blacked out. and if i uninstall it I will loose 6 months of information i will not reinstall it."

But when I had to switch phones the data file corrupted and I couldn\'t transfer any of them. Also, it \"stops working\" ALLLLLL the time. Randomly crashes! I\'ve reported this bug SO many times and it was never fixed. Makes me think they just wanted access to my info from the report. Overall I\'m tired of it crashing and them ignoring my crash reports, so I\'m looking elsewhere."

Permissions not as intrusive as other apps that send out messages to your contacts without you knowing. This app has more respect for privacy. Will recommend this one to friends."

And if there was a way to sign in so that info tracked on different device transfers seamlessly from device to device. I was using my iPod and had this app on there I lost my iPod and only have an android phone so I just added the app to my phone and realized I had to reinput everything back :(...I don\'t remember any of that info"

One suggestion: it would be nice to have a mark for when you get your period without losing the mark for when you were supposed to get your period. I couldn\'t live without this app! It makes visits to my ob/gyn so much easier!"

After doing a reset and installing the app. I wanted to restore it from back up. Well my phone didn\'t have an sdcard.  If I got the corect error message when I was backing up I wouldn\'t have lost all that data. I would have fix the problem!! Sucks when developers do a bad job on error handling."

Easy to use, no nonsense, color coated calendar which is a huge plus, and helped estimate and predict ovulation and cycles. One thing is it had trouble changing some of the colors for things. Maybe too much tech for a simple app. Will probably update my review later when I start using it again!"

I can disable all the bells and whistles because I\'m not using this to get pregnant, and its simple and nice looking. And I can change the look of the calendar however I want!"

I still keep a hard copy of all my info but I am begging to live this app again. Have rated it a 3 for now only because I am a little apprehensive about using this again. Will compare it with the other app I have and see where that goes."
