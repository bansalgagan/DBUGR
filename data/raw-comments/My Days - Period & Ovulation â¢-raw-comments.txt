  text: "It ok but disappointed\tI downloaded this app and had it a while, but then for some reason it wasn\'t working out when my next period was due it was telling me less days than what it was, so it was giving me the wrong ovulation days etc. Other than that it was a good app to download at first when it was working properly; so this didn\'t work for me. So rather disappointed with it now and time to find a new one what may help."

Your period is already complicated so your app shouldn\'t be, and this app is just what is needed so quick and easy to help get pregnant or not, or just to track your periods. GIVE IT A TRY ; )"

I\'ve even installed it on my loved ones\' phones. For the past several months, however, the alarms/reminders do not show and the expected start dates are off by several days to a week. This is not the accuracy I\'ve come to know and love about this app. Fix that and I\'ll gladly up my rating to a full 5 stars and give a positive review."

Thank goodness I saved my data before I changed this month\'s start date, or I wouldn\'t have been able to get back a year\'s worth of data. But it still deletes past start-end dates when you change the current start date. Makes it hard to calculate if my cycle\'s number of days is changing. Frustrating. I\'ve used this app for two years, hoping this issue would be fixed. Gonna start looking for another app..."

However I have been trying to conceive shhhhhhhhh and no luck yet. but if you looking to track you Lady Friend this app is great.  and usually I don\'t take time out to do these comments"

I would pay for a version that saves info. Please consider and thank you."

It\'s always been nearly 100% accurate for me, as long as I make sure to enter information correctly. I love that I can add notes to specific days, which helps me document medical details. I\'m also happy that I can change the colors. I keep mine dark/black which helps me feel more discrete if I need to open the app where prying eyes wander. Totally recommend this app."

Ive never had a problem up until I decided to upgrade phones.. of course when I downloaded the newest version and tried to use my SD backup it gives an error and lately it gives me a crash error even when I don\'t have the app open. I almost wish I could revert to the older version. I\'ve also noticed my pill alarm doesn\'t take me to the app,  wish it did,  or add \'took pill\' when tapped."

The legend clearly states what and where everything is, there are no misunderstandings. This app needs work."

Day 14 as ovulation and day 28 to start period."

I want to save in app my doctor\'s contact info, for easier communication, set reminders to pick up/fill prescriptions, and have an easier method of taking notes over just a blank notepad. It could be like what my doctor reviews so I\'m ready for each visit."

Still I don\'t really think that\'s necessary for a tracker app. Also, there is no other change in that update - my sister downloaded this app a few days ago and the app had lots of features like mucus levels - and it wasn\'t even my days x, just the regular one. When I updated mine nothing was changed at all!"

  text: "Great app and not all pink\tOne of the big draws for me was custom color options. TAKE NOTE PERIOD APP MAKER PEOPLE (in shouty caps). I dont know why pink is the reigning theme for period calculators. This app wins. Deftly avoids cartoon bunnies, furry animals, growing or wilting flowers. Period app+female=User is *not* 8 years old. I would like something other than baby pepto Barbie pink. This app allowed custom colors - and a widget that isnt too frou frou.  Great custom options, works well."

That would be great, but it\'s just not correct! It needs a way to tell it you\'re pregnant so that it doesn\'t average that 9 month break in with your regular cycle. I have been using it for years & don\'t want to delete my info just to set it straight again. Please fix & I would give it a full 5 stars."

I am currently expecting and this app has a lot to do with it. I have done my research and the my ovulation date according to this app is the same as what it is according to my doctor. The color coded calendar is extremely helpful, and the alarms/notifications you can activate are helpful too. I will definitely keep this app around."

I have had to start all over again with every new phone because there is no way to back up the data online. The appearance and design of the app is long due for an overhaul. This is not 2009 where people were just happy to have functioning android apps anymore."

The only down side is that it can get useless once you are pregnant.  Hopefully there is a way where you can input a \"pregnant\" option so it can give tips and helpful information throughout your pregnancy."

It lacks a little bit if you are charting with fertility in mind too... but that might be a bit more than you can really do well in an app I don\'t know... :) there\'s my critical review :) I pop my info into the app but then chart it out on my paper every few days to get the big picture of where I\'m at."

My boyfriend laughs at me for tracking when we have sex but in case I get pregnant, it\'ll help determine my due date and that is Awesome to have on hand! Also, I don\'t have a regular cycle. I have a period about every 6-9 weeks and it\'s nice to NOT be worried about why I\'m not having a cycle when I expect (because I never carry a calendar)Plus I like to rub it in his face if we haven\'t been active for a while lol ;)"

Some times I get a reminder, other times I received it at a later time than what I set my reminder and often I don\'t receive a reminder at all. Can you please fix this issue? My rating will change to five stars... :-)"

Now it has totally blacked out. and if i uninstall it I will loose 6 months of information i will not reinstall it."

But when I had to switch phones the data file corrupted and I couldn\'t transfer any of them. Also, it \"stops working\" ALLLLLL the time. Randomly crashes! I\'ve reported this bug SO many times and it was never fixed. Makes me think they just wanted access to my info from the report. Overall I\'m tired of it crashing and them ignoring my crash reports, so I\'m looking elsewhere."

  text: "Great app\tVery easy to use and follow. Got pregnant based on the fertile days/range. Would give it 5 stars if there was an option for pregnancy possibility...when to test. And if there was a way to sign in so that info tracked on different device transfers seamlessly from device to device. I was using my iPod and had this app on there I lost my iPod and only have an android phone so I just added the app to my phone and realized I had to reinput everything back :(...I don\'t remember any of that info"

Easy to use, no nonsense, color coated calendar which is a huge plus, and helped estimate and predict ovulation and cycles. One thing is it had trouble changing some of the colors for things. Maybe too much tech for a simple app. Will probably update my review later when I start using it again!"

It would be AMAZING and so helpful if this app had the capability to be shared with your significant other on their phone, whatever you enter on your phone syncs with their phone. So 1 account on 2 phones, would that be possible?  That feature would totally bring my rating up to 5 stars!"

I just found out I was pregnant again.. although this time it wasn\'t planned.  Mark your dates for beginning, and ending of your cycle..and when you have sex. Hope it helps you all as it did for me. Definitely a must have!"
