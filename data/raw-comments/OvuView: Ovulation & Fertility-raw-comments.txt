I used the app religiously as directed. After several months, I noticed after ovulation had already occurred, the app would shift the predicted ovulation day by 3-5 days. I always planned to accommodate accordingly, however it ended up biting me in the butt after my period was off one month. 2-3 months later, here I am pregnant. Bummed about the timing!"

I uninstalled this app right away! Horrible!!! Hated it, can\'t say enough bad about it."

  text: "Great data tracking\tI\'m using this to try to find patterns in my symptoms. I\'ve spent the past 10 years of my life thinking I\'m irregular and erratic in my menses, due to how I\'d forget to take proper tract of my menstrual cycle, and never do the math to figure things out. This app is super easy to use and does all the work for me. As long as I take a minute every day to remember to enter my data for the day!"

  text: "Love this App\tI played around with a few different apps when we were first trying to conceive, and I settled on this one.  It does have some difficulty with atypical cycles (I have PCOS, didn\'t learn that until halfway through) as it will show fertility levels up for a long time, but that was the same issue I had with the fertility monitor I purchased for a lot more money.  However, this app will adjust while the monitor just ate expensive sticks.    While TTC, it was also easy to adjust to my cycles and play around with it.  Not the apps fault my PCOS came into play, although I\'d like to be able to somehow clue it in that I have that diagnosis.  Still, this is the only app I\'ve ever paid for so I could get the charts to email to my doctor.  It was only $5--not bad for an app.    It was scarily accurate when I did become pregnant as to my due date--my due date is only one day off .  It is pretty easy to change, although you have to play with the app itself--touch the baby icon to change.   I can still use it while pregnant to track what\'s going on.  Everything downloaded perfectly when I got a new phone.  Still love this app."

I\'ve tried A LOT of other app but this one I\'ve kept because it easy and my period is not every 28 days (sometimes 24 sometimes 29) so this app just let me put in when and starting, spotting etc. More wiggle room while other apps won\'t let me change when I start or end my period (example GLOW &lt;- which does have good interface)"

I can keep track of my cycles, when I\'ve been active, if I\'m using my medicine, my mood and take notes. My doctors are impressed I was able to give such much information and I have a bad memory from previous cancer treatment so this is a life saver. As for pregnancy, I wouldn\'t know because I can\'t have kids. If I do by some miracle, I\'m extremely high risk and was told by doctors I\'d be bed rest entire time."

However, I really wish I was able to use the reminder feature without buying the paid app."

The symptom chart is wonderful, now it is easy to see the patterns and phases my body goes through before my period. I had 5 friends download so I could get the full version free-will NEVER regret or forget this app! Highly recommended!"

This is compatible with every-single charting method and highly customizable. whether you are avoiding pregnancy or trying for it, i highly recommend it. For all methods though, you\'re best to be properly educated on how to avoid/try for pregnancy. The app is a great tool though."

  text: "Doesn\'t adjust to atypical cycles\tI entered 2 years of cycles from another application. Most of my cycles are 31 days but for three months, they were 25, 25, 22, and then they returned to normal. Because of the really short cycles, the application now shows me as constantly fertile and only shows 2 days of menses (even though I\'ve entered 5 days). It\'s easy enough to use but obviously the algorithm can\'t handle the occasional atypical cycle."

The first thing you do is to set your goal, and you can then use it as just a period tracker, to learn about your cycle and when NOT to have sex if you are avoiding children right now. In every situation, though, it\'s a helpful and simple app."

I was looking for a new ovulation app top use that would take in to account the miscarriage I experienced. This one does the calculating for you in regards to ovulation range, using information you only about temperature, ovulation tests, etc. I like that it syncs reminders to test or track with my phone\'s morning alarm."

  text: "Can\'t see the hype about this\tI have been using Ovuview for 5 months now, checking my temperature, cervix and mucus regularly as it requires. Most of the fancy methods contradict each other or have applicability 0 for reasons that make no sense, like \"not enough tracked cycles\" for a method that requires two tracked cycles, or \"not a single complete cycle\". The app is actually calculating my phases based on counting days from the last time I bled. I might as well use any other of the less sophisticated apps to calculate my ovulation."

Then I got a new phone and could not transfer my information and I can\'t figure it how to get it back into pregnancy mode from just restarting it. It is difficult to use in this way. I even tried googling how to do it, no luck. If you can tell me how to fix this I will re-rate the app."

Excellent widgets. Definitely buy the $2 in app upgrades! But still great if you don\'t.  UPDATE: using this for a year, still absolutely love it.  occasionally I play with new apps to see if they can beat it; they never do.  many  updates with new features, awesome! UPDATE: I took Ovia/Ouvline for a test drive... lame!  Very inaccurate, not as flexible as this.  This can keep up with fluctuating cycle length when others can\'t.  Don\'t bother looking for anything else."

Having PMDD is hard to manage but this app keeps me in check and helps me understand when to expect bad days.  Going to get the pro version too!"

But by entering even my random ovulation and period days, the app managed to predict when my next ovulation/period is  due quite accurately. So when I was a week overdue (which is too late even by my standards!) I knew I was pregnant! Really helps you to learn what goes on in your body and be more in tune with it."

I didn\'t trust the app straight away, but so far it is matching my prediction on paper! I am very satisfied, it has a great look it is very easy to set up and it has a lots of different info that you can put in for you use, and it also explains every method in case you have any doubts. Just got the premium version. The only missing option is an automatic sync between all your devices"

It can be moved to the SD card, what helps if your phone doesn\'t have much internal storage as mine, but then the alarm can\'t be set. It is in multiple languages with good translations (I\'ve checked English and Spanish). The number of sympthoms   that you can track is huge, and you can predict your fertility periods with different methods, being more or less conservative depending on your choice."

Please create another method that will allow me to move my data from one phone to another without an SD card. Thank you!"

  text: "Best ttc I have!\tThings I love: the symptoms are rated by intensity not just inputted so days that have worse you can mark it.  All the different methods for tracking and confirming ovulation. This app was more accurate than fertility friend on my o date and expected period date. Things I don\'t like: very hard to use at first. They do have a practice feature but still. Some of the good tracking methods are only for premium. Premium only costs like $5 though."

There\'s a place for every symptom you can think if but I like that you can turn on or off symptoms.  Some I\'ll never use and it would be just clutter to me so I like that it doesn\'t have to be there. It\'s been right on and actually helped me get pregnant. This app is really helpful and useful. There should be an i-version as I know of a couple people looking for one. I couldn\'t find one on their phone that I like as much as this one"

  text: "Best app for tracking cycles!\tI tried about ten different apps for tracking cycles, and this one wins hands down. The clean interface, simple input, and handy charts are fantastic. I love that it uses different fertility tracking methods... and because this app makes it so easy, I even started using the symptothermal tracking method. If I had to do all the work myself I probably wouldn\'t have bothered. Great app, thank you!"

  text: "Pro features not great\tWould have given 5 stars but I\'m extremely disappointed with pregnancy mode. It would be nice to look ahead in the calendar view to see the weeks and trimesters to help plan Dr. appointments and trips. For example, you can\'t get dental work done during 1st trimester and are supposed to stay near home starting around 36 weeks, it only tells you the number of days you are pregnant which is virtually pointless. Loved the fertility tracking but wouldn\'t have upgraded if I knew the pro functions weren\'t worth it"

This is the most in-depth, thorough ovulation app I\'ve used... and watching the daily count down through my pregnancy has been wonderful. 10 days left, and I HONESTLY believe this tracker helped us conceive, so thank you."

I love how many symptoms can be tracked and the algorithms for predicting my period are usually pretty close.   The only thing I don\'t like is that you can only enter BBT to the tenth place even though most literature recommends recording BBT to the hundredth place for fertility tracking."

Similar to the Temp or Weight toggle option on the charts.  Many ladies track different things that aren\'t always easy to discribe in the notes section...and certainly not easy to scroll through when reviewing past symptoms.  Please help! Thanks.. :)"

This app combines everything together so you have 1 app that gives you any information you need about your time. Then widget is my favourite feature, no need to open the app at all, indicators can be right on your home screen. I paid for the extra features and to be honest I dont even know what that includes, paying for it was still very much worth it."

Only complaint (and it\'s a big one) is there is little to no interaction between the company and its users...meaning, send a question to the company, and they will never respond. If possible, stick to the free version of the app because paying for it entails greater expectations the company currently doesn\'t meet. :/ It\'s a shame too because the app is good."

I really appreciate being able to track so many symptoms,  as well. Being able to track my hormone-related acne has helped me pinpoint my trouble times during the month and head them off with some preventative skincare. Practically no more period pimples!  Definitely one of the best women\'s health apps ever!"

I paid for premium and it\'s very worth it. I use a dark theme to be gentle on my eyes when I input cervix data  the evening and basal body temperature in the morning. I hope these developers make other apps, to observe other aspects of health."

Been using it for almost 3 years in the FREE mode, and I love how it stores info so I don\'t lose it phone to phone, and the different settings from period tracker to ovulation or as contraception... And its right on, if you use it right! I feel like I know my body more, and can predict things now that I see my personal patterns. Obviously, Love it."

Also, if I write a long note it\'s very easy for me to accidentally unset it."

There is very little that can be done to improve it, though there are a few things I\'d do to change the custom options. It\'s completely worth it to buy the premium features, especially for backups!!! I LOVE how the backups also give you the option to save the graphs as well as having it in spreadsheet format for people like me. Buy this app! You won\'t regret it!"

I used to track temp on paper. I love love love it but it FREEZES and then FORCE STOPS every time I go to chart view. I paid for this and want it to work. Please fix and you will definitely get 5 stars."

I\'m very disappointed because I paid for the extra features and now it\'s messing up all the time. Seems like before I bought the extras it ran a lot smoother, not so much now.. :("

Women often are weepy due to hormones but not \"depressed\" or \"sad\". - Ability to synch one acct/info on separate phones please (i.e. my husband wants to be able to see our data on his phone). This would allow both partners to see fertile times, etc. Would be wonderful addition!!"

Had a tech savvy friend of mine look at it. We discovered 10,000+ (not joking) random files ALL over the place that were created by this app. In places they never should have been in the first place (like the ringtones, music, books, pictures, etc files.) It was almost like a virus. Everywhere. After cleaning it up and uninstalling the app, phone works great again."

It\'s got everything i wanted to know about my cycle so when we decided to start trying for a baby  immediately following our June wedding, i found out i was pregnant mid October. I used the pregnancy mode after that. It was great seeing it.visualized as a wheel. My only criticism is that i couldn\'t find how i imputed baby\'s birthday so ended up deleting it and re installing it to re set it. I\'m still a fan."

  text: "Highly Disappointed!\tAfter nearly 3 years of being a satisfied user of the paid version, I update and the OvuView icon has overwritten and backed up on every single file I have on my SD card and my phone memory.\302\240 Whenever I click on any of them, it acts like OvuView data restore and takes me to the OvuView app and asks to restore. It\'s corrupted and prevented me from opening my files! My response from you is this is the way your program has been rewritten for Gmail capabilities. REALLY?! UNINSTALLED & UNHAPPY!"

  text: "Beautiful.\tIve used this app for 6 cycles. To borrow from a review I read the other day..\"This app is like the perfect man. He listens,even when you rant. Diligently taking notes, so you can look back with him and discuss it in great detail later. EVERY LITTLE DETAIL. He even remembers the important times of the month without being reminded. You don\'t realise how much you need him, until he\'s not around. Then you miss him.\" Perfect App."
