Been using this on three device now almost two years since first developed...\tThis app should be include on all capable Devices..I have a pop up browser on my note 3 but the darn thing closes at weirdest times and is broke partly because ported from note 2. Whereas this app let\'s you share either thy url, or you can have it sent as plain text which is great for articles,close windows and reopen from notification, switch tabs, etc. No clue why this isn\'t more popular but one of first apps I put on any of mine or the wife\'s devices...

I think changing the ugly internet explorer icon in the notification bar, and improving the icon will go a long way to making this app more popular and visible in Android news blogs. Will definitely spend some money on it if devs can refine the design even more"

I stopped updating apps because apps always went backwards so if an app worked I left it alone.I got a new phone installed this app and notice a performance difference. Apple updates every new iOS version. It seems Google updates every week or month to change advertising and/or add unnecessary intrusive permissions, which essentially has become what  Android\'s mission."

There gotta be plenty of icons on the web to use the one that I hate the most. I feel shame when someone ask me about it :P.   It reload the tabs when I switch them. <----ANNOYING  Don\'t expect me to buy a medium built browser just because it floats. I want a solution, not another problematic app.  Outdated. This doesn\'t even support CCS stuff like dropshadow.   You have the tools, use them!"

The most important issue that I have is that the keyboard doesn\'t always pop up when I click in a text box other than the address bar. The only way for me to type when it decides not to pop up is to click in the web address bar and when the keyboard pops up, click in the text box in the browser. Plus you can highlight \"a\" word but you can\'t copy or paste or download anything .... Fix these issues and this app is easily 5 *\'s. Thanks in advance."

I open Pintrest app and then click on open this browser to look at the items while still in Pintrest.  The browser window is resizable and is a fully functional browser... It has become my go to browser app... can\'t go wrong with this one."

So you can never fully close your tabs; at least one will be back. - The focus often goes to the address bar for no reason, opening the keyboard all the time. Keep a finger close to the Back button. More updates needed!"

Makes my tablet feel more like a desktop computer.  -A few problems fixed and this browser would be the best:  -Smoother scrolling on web pages would be fantastic.  -Faster switching between tabs would be nice. As it currently stands (when switching from tab to tab), each tab has to reload. That\'s bad.  -Editable bookmarks.  -Be able to go back a page on the internet by pressing the back button on the navigation bar. Every other browser does this. Please fix!  -Ability to open a new tab or refresh page without having to open the settings button. This would make things a lot faster.  Thanks very much though! I\'m going to continue using this just for its novelty feature of being able to minimize - sooo cool!"

  text: "Good but.. :(\tNot recommended for phones with small screen.. Not unless you wanna play youtube vids continously while browsing other webite.. Kinda slow if your screen saver is animated.. It lags but not that much on my sG ace 5830 2.3.5.. Need improvement coz you cant reduce the window to the desired size that you want plus there is no desktop option which means you cant see whos online if your browsing FB. But never the less.. Its good.. Just dont over do the multitasking not unless you want ur phone to lag :P"

Another issue,which is not that major for me is the memory usage, it\'s quite high which tends to close the browser when memory gets full.. But that rarely happens though, so I\'m still giving five stars because this app is just so awesome.."
