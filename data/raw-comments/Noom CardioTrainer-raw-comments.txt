Been a pro member for just over a year and I highly recommend all Noom\'s Apps. :D P.S.-Mine downloads to Facebook, keeps old workouts and keeps great step count while playing music.:)"

Frst, the music should be paused as an audible sign that the workout is paused. Secondly, user should be asked to confirm the user really wants to pause. I can\'t tell you how many times I thought my workout was being recorded only to look at the end to see it was on pause the whole time. Please fix this huge problem."

  text: "Breaks Noom Weight Loss Coach HRM\tI\'ve been using Noom Weight Loss Coach with a Polar Bluetooth Heart Rate Monitor.   It\'s been great except it only shows 7 and 30 day summaries of exercise.  I downloaded this app in the hopes of being able to go back and review individual exercises.  My HRM stopped working with Noom Coach and it took 3 days for me to figure out this was the cause.  Noom Cardio falsely report that my Android or Bluetooth version is too old, even though I have the latest version of each.  Uninstalled, rebooted, and the HRM and Noom Coach went right back to working normally."

  text: "Couple of flaws in it\tI use this app on a daily basis. There are 3 things to be fixed. 1. Skiing.  Why the application counts calories when going up? When you are in a chairlift, no calories are consumed. More over, the distances counted when going up have to be counted separatelly. 2. Why don t you put a lock on the screen by default? Couple of times I stopped accidentally the recording. It s a tiny fix. Runtastic has it.  3. Moreover, if you accidentally pause it, why the apps does not start when moving?"

I measured the sake route with my car and there is little over a 1 mile discrepancy and sometimes it will pause itself mid workout which is a little annoying. Other than that it works better and it shows on a map your route which is cool and I haven\'t been able to find another app that does that."

Still my favorite fitness app but I might switch to using strava for everything soon if this app is getting left behind by devs.  Old review: I use this app for all my running, biking, hiking and other stuff. Even if you can\'t track it at the time you can still enter in things like ice hockey or just about any other sport."

Within that app you get a link to Noom Coach and  sadly it does not reflect my recorded exercise history vs the calorie intake logged in Noom Coach. I find it redundant to log exercise in both. It would be great if they synched without having to log everything twice since the apps are connected. Otherwise, its a great app for keeping calorie intake log :)..."

  text: "Pretty Decent\tI like most of the features and functionality with the following exceptions.  On my sense Samsung Galaxy S3 the GPS stays active after a workout is complete.  This drains the battery unnecessarily.  Selecting workout type after hitting \"Start Workout\" is not intuitive to me.  It seems like I should tell it what I\'m going to do first and then start the workout. I keep all my music in Google Play, at least for my running.  Any chance you could support other music players.  I like avocados fine, but I don\'t want to know how many I can eat after every run.  Switch it up a little.  Tell me how many beers I can have or how much cheesecake I just burned off.  Obviously only the first item is a real issue and I\'m still probably going to buy the full app."

Their website doesn\'t work properly anymore, their support community has been deactivated, the link to their website from the Playstore/Market is incorrect. Updates provide no new features. No offline maps possible, so you need a data plan or have to pay a lot for data. So, the more you run, the more you have to pay."

Some of the bugs that existed YEARS ago still aren\'t fixed, and the GPS code in particular needs a lot of work.  Support links in the app point to Google Support groups that aren\'t followed by the developers anymore.  With that said, CardioTrainer still \'works\' for tracking my runs.  It\'s just really disappointing that the app has been abandoned."

  text: "Great app\tOverall it\'s a great app. I love that I can switch from multiple types of workouts and it combines them into total distance and calories by week, month and year. Also it\'s pretty cool that I can see how far I have traveled on the world map, I\'m in Mexico to the south and Canada to the north right now. Watch out South America and Alaska, coming there soon! There are two issues that keep it from getting 5 stars. The first is that if you switch phones  or have to redownload because of phone issues you lose all details of the individual workouts even though you keep the overall distance and calories burned. The second is it doesn\'t incorporate elevation changes."

It\'s cumbersome to have to use Google Music to paly my music and CardioTrainer for my workout, not to mention battery drain.  I\'ve been reading the board at the website and see where they say they are working on their own music player so they are not reliant on Google Music or affected by the OS upgrades, but that was a long time ago and I\'ve seen nothing saying that they are making headway. So if you don\'t mind having to fumble between apps while trying to get your workout in to the music on your Android, this is an excellent app.  I think Noom is capable of much more."

It does post to Facebook but, if you click the link it posts in Chrome, you get a blank page.  When you click the link in IE, it doesn\'t give accurate data at all.  It looks like a completely different person that is walking in New York.  It\'s like dummy info is posted."

So the app has not been updated in over a  year it has many bugs that have been reported but the developer seems to have abandoned the app. I really hope I am wrong because I love the app but it needs updating. I have the pro version and I feel like they have/are just taking the money and forsaking their users.  Does anyone know how to get google to take a look at a app and pull abandoned apps?"

Also, walking/running should use GPS as step count is not too accurate. With a 1.3m stride it\'s closer though, but that took a month to get too via trial and error on known distances."

I did one mile at 3mph as per my treadmill,  and cardio trainer shows it at 3 miles @ 7 mph way off...have updated and even reinstated,  makes me wonder if ALL my workouts are this inaccurate. So I have to go over just to balance...can you please fix?"

For about the last 3 weeks I\'ve been unable to access the servers and it keeps telling me to check my Internet connection. My connection is fine. It still records my scores but I cannot access the servers. Others appear to be having the same problem or similar. Tech support has been non-existent and I can even get a progress update or acknowledgement of where the problem resides. I am at the point of just ceasing to use this app, and trying to export all my 3.5k miles to Garmin. For me the World High Scores was a integral part of my workout routine."

It also has trouble cross-posting workouts to Facebook; it only works sometimes, no rhyme or reason. And it has a big delay. Most recently, it sometimes pauses when I\'m still walking &/or doesn\'t record all my steps. PLEASE release an update/fix! Thanks. There\'s so much I like about this app but these issues are slowly ruining it. Samsung Galaxy S3 w/ Jellybean OS."

My usual walk might read 3.3-3.6 miles daily.  I\'d don\'t take new routes so I feel this can make a difference when counting calories.  Since the GPS isn\'t in sync my mph is usually off also."

  text: "Wow\tHave recently installed other apps to see if they offered more, strava, runtastic mountain bike, mapmyride ALL of those crash or hang when an internet connection is lost. Cardiotrainer is the only one that doesn\'t because it\'s not trying to constantly upload, which crashes the system and sucks up resources needlessly, it\'s enough to upload when you tell it to upload, which is when I\'m connected to the internet and not trying to upload when I\'m not connected and then hanging/crashing and totally wiping out my log or starting it over, EACH TIME! Furthermore, some might look nice but lack basics that cardiotrainer has, autopause, can see on a map complete history of distance traveled. Cardiotrainer goes further by showing how far you have traveled in your total history your distance on a map, I\'ve walked/biked now to toronto a distance of over 200 miles from me :)"

I tried the racing feature to race against myself and my music wouldn\'t play and I couldn\'t hear the voice telling me how ahead/behind I was, no matter how high up I set the volume. I ended up beating my time by nearly a minute and it showed I was behind about 80 yards. strange!"

  text: "Used to be good\tCardioTrainer, the first app of it\'s kind on Android, personal support from Artem (the original developer), notwit\'s never updated and stuck in the past. There\'s a whole team behind it now, doesn\'t feel as personal as it did. I really wanted to keep supporting it as it was the first one and it did it\'s job well. Then Android 4.0 came out and it never updated it\'s support for it, music integration stopped, frequent crashes. Support weren\'t interested as they were too busy with Noom which they asked me to move to even though it was overkill for everyone who just wants to track their workouts. Every time I reported a problem I got the reply \"Sorry, we\'re working on Noom right now, please can you try that and see if you still have the issue\". No, I don\'t want bloatware on my phone, thanks."

Great for me as I stop to do push ups etc. Would like to see a mode which makes buttons bigger and easier to get to when moving as it can be a bit fiddly,  especially when tired.  I don\'t need on screen map until I\'ve finished.  Not a big thing but would be nice. Worth a download."

I have downloaded other apps in the past that have not included this option (android).  I love the history and the ability to write notes.  The only hang up is that when viewing history my notes don\'t show up so in order to see my notes I have to go into the particular event. Other than that it\'s great and I highly recommend it for pace keeping, distance tracking, course recording and history."

  text: "Used to use it everyday but now I won\'t even download it bc of all the privacy invasions required to accept. Be careful, a cardio app shouldn\'t have any reason to keep track of phone call, texts, contacts, when contact are made w the added permission of sharing that info w third parties w no restrictions or notifications.\tGreat motivational app.   By keeping track of miles walked and/or run each day with a running total for a each week it pushes you to do more than the day before or just some at all. Also helps you realize that just 15-20 minutes walking equals a mile. In the beginning I started w a mile or so at lunch and slowly built up to 5 miles/day just to beat the week and months total  before."

  text: "Abandoned by developer?\tI was an early adopter of this program and use it daily. It was and continues to be excellent. But the developer hasn\'t updated it since Jan 12 2012. Over a year without a change? Has the developer abandoned this program or just decided you shouldn\'t mess with perfection? And on my phone, its still labeled \"beta.\"!  How about a way to save and export GPS track data, apart from downloading each track individually?  How about a way to save weight data? Everytime I get a new phone, I lose all my weight data?  How about an updated UI or one that is customizable by the user? I never use \"friend activity\" and I\'d love to be able to personalize it to to have \"log workout\" on the main screen. Or make the buttons a bit smaller and put all of them on one screen -- especially as phone screens are getting bigger and bigger, this seems a reasonable option (one that could, perhaps, be set in the \"settings\").  How about supporting more than one brand of heart-rate monitor?"

Currently running both just in case one doesn\'t work. It\'s been cardio that last ten plus times.

The calorie count seems to not take advantage of some data that is available to the app. (Ex: distance and elevation change) It seems to only calculate based on indicated activity (ex: hiking) and time. Calorie counting is my main purpose for this app so I\'m weighting this heavy.  2. My play list just stops about one out of every 5 workouts. It should be set up on a \"repeat all\" play back.  Other than that, it\'s a pretty cool app."

  text: "Fantastic app but missing a few features\tA great app that (mostly) does what it says.  I haven\'t had a chance to test out the social integration yet but the GPS tracking is robust and the exercise tracking and logging works well.   Interestingly, the interface of the app is not the same as the interface in the screenshots within the play store - there is no navigation menu along the bottom of the app and the start screen is different.  Perhaps an older version had been used to create these.    Also, there is no option to schedule more than one activity per day - a large oversight given that most people schedule more than one activity per day.  For example, you may ride to work and then ride home from work.  That\'s two activities.  Or you may go for a walk on your lunch break and then go to the gym when you get home.  That\'s another two activities.  Or you may ride to the beach, go for a surf and then ride home.  That\'s three activities.  With the current features available you can schedule one of these activities per day, but not all of them.  You can, however, log more than one activity per day."

Worked fine once this app was removed. Also, app will not allow selection of playliets. Says it foes but it wont. Since music while running is a must, this app fails for getting that simple part wrong."

Now every time I save my route and click on share, it posts a thumbnail picture of where I ran but doesn\'t show the route and spams everyone to go to the disfunctional facebook cardio trainer page, which is completely blank.  If anyone clicks on any of the links to my post, they\'re taken to this generic blank page and no one can see any of the routes that I ran. I hope they fix this."

By lunch time I had 41% battery.  I didn\'t use my phone except picked up a 2 minute phone call and received 2 text that I reply back to each. That\'s it.  My S3 battery with my fumbling on social network, check the news, texts, calls and play games will drain down to an average of 67% by the early evening around 6pm-7pm.  I couldn\'t do that that day because my battery has gone down to 41% at lunch. Then by 3:30pm when it\'s time to go home my battery without being used and just placed on my desk has gone down to 3%. All I have to say is don\'t download this if you want to prolong your phone battery life. This app sucks your battery life in the background even though it doesn\'t show on the running app screen."

Support, website analysis poor.\tBeen using for 2+ years as a paying user, the app works ok, calorie medals are nice BUT  1) analysis is limited 2) website slow 3) the noom team seems to ignore CT issues (of which I\'ve had a few) - e.g. try the website \"export workout history\", not working was reported over 4.5 months ago and still not fixed. So how many miles did I run/cycle in 2012, no easy way to check. 4) unable to BULK RESCUE my data (650 tracks) from the website to analyse/backup offline. The other apps (Strava / Endomondo) have much more responsive support teams. (strava was very good!) Calories burned reads high for running and cycling, making it easy to over eat while replacing calories. Come on CT/noom please buck up your ideas and give me a good reason to edit this again."

It is a shame that it has been abandoned by Noom because it has the potential to be so much better with a few small adjustments.  I will stick with it until something better comes along that has the support it deserves."

It needs better statistics on the web and some small updates with fixes and/or new features from time to time.  It is apparent that they chose to promote their weight loss app but for us who only care about exercising, noom weight loss coach is an annoying app."

  text: "Decent App for tracking activities\tI have used this for a week mainly to log my exercise during breaks and walking the dog.  GPS takes a while to get a signal (more phone related I know) so not sure if there is a tweak in the app to help with that.  Love the pause workout button and music controls.  Tracking past workouts is great and the global comparison is pretty cool.  My biggest issue is the interface and getting from stat screen to Home screen, it shuts down sometimes when I try."

I wish for a clearer voice for the announcements, but it does not deducts any stars."

It wasn\'t until this app, that I started going everyday, at first walking, then running a mile, and now walking and running 2 miles a day. You see how many calories you burned, you have GPS data on your route, and it motivates you to go everyday so you can meet your goals and it keeps your history. Great app."

  text: "Great so far, excellent for walkers\tI\'ve been using the free version almost daily on my VM Optimus Slider for walking for about three months, and have only had a couple of hiccups so far as the phone freezing up.  Instant upload to the user page and ability to export stats are great--I have exports set up to crunch monthly totals in a database. Would like to try integrating the WearLink+ heart rate monitor so I can more automatically track other kinds of workouts but have seen mixed reviews.  Wish GooglePlay allowed searching reviews!  Music integration doesn\'t play my list in the correct order but I just play the music separately (starting it first, then opening CT) and I can hear the CT prompts over it.  This works well since I can navigate tracks with my BT headphones.  It would be nice to be able to edit workouts as other say."

Noom and Cardio Trainer do not communicate with each other.  I\'ve checked the settings and wasted time trying to make them integrate.  But I still love both of these apps and would greatly appreciate the ability to merge the data entered & tracked in Noom with the Cardio Trainer app.  Other than that it is very helpful, I\'ve already lost 30lbs and only have 15lbs more to go!"

I don\'t like that I can\'t use the calorie medal to access the app, but have to open it from the tray.  Biggest issue is that if I change anything about a scheduled workout, it immediately erases that from my weekly calendar view. Annoying and demotivating!! Fix for 5*!"

Both of the other apps take into account elevation, which it seems Cardiotrainer doesn\'t. I\'ve actually used all three apps (on separate devices) on the same run multiple times, and Cardiotrainer consistently varies and is incorrect, while the other two are spot on. Noom is gonna have to step it up to win me back!"

It\'s sync however needs to be updated because I have it on my HTC Desire S & Flyer but if I log on one device it takes forever to update, if it does.  Quite accurate in estimating the amount of calories burnt and love that it has lots of pre installed activities."

Only problem is the Friend Activity. None of us have access to it! Disappointing because knowing what everyone else is doing would make it competitive without have to look for the shared workouts on Facebook! Fix it so everyone can see their friend activity and ill give it 5 stars!"

I\'ve tried and tested millions of fitness products and apps and this is one of the best. It\'s free too, so you\'d be silly not to try it."

I originally had it in Indiana, and now that I\'m in Istanbul it still works great!  I wanted to support the developers and buy the Pro version, but I don\'t really need it."

GPS accurate but lately won\'t show streets I\'m on in case I get \"lost\". Does not count for moms walking/jogging w/ strollers or carrying infant/toddler. Recommend adding 50+ cal post workout."

Would like to see it record elevation as well and take that into consideration when calculating Calorie Burn. Also Calorie Counting is off a bit.. if i manually enter a run it will record less calories than if i track it via GPS. otherwise good..im happy with it"
