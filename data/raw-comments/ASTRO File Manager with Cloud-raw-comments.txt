KK ruined this and many other apps.  Only way to fix is if phone is rooted and warranty voided on my new phone.  Had to go back to the builtin file manager.  If the author can find a way to get around this KK security bug I would use ASTRO again."

The task killer is just pointless. This app used to be amazing, but now it seams like so much junk is thrown in that the functions I got the app for are either, no longer available or they are just so watered down that it\'s impossible to use it. If it is fixed i will rate higher. I loved this app, when it worked."

When I am on the net and I edited a text file with Astro that was previously edited with Jota and/or notepad, the formatting is destroyed when I open the text file in notepad. All the carriage returns are removed, piling all the text together. The format looked fine in the Astro editor, but was trashed in notepad. Restoring from backup and removing the program. Just configured ES File Explorer to access my Box and it edits the file just fine and formatting stays intact. However, ESF will not open an offline file when I\'m not connected to the net. Sigh and arggg. Why can\'t they get this right??? Asana and Ziplist work fine when offline and sync up when connected. Those apps are wonderful by the way, get them and learn \'em."

ES file explorer has no adds, can browse apk files, backs up EVERY apk on my phone, has tons of themes, lets me delete locations if I want to, and has better view settings.   I cannot see using this as my only file manager.  It has one advantage though - it works in multi-window.   So that is the only reason I have it.  Try ES file explorer first and see if you like it better.    By the way, astro was my first file manager almost two years ago.  I jumped ship and am so glad I did."

What the-- Now it won\'t navigate properly? Come on!  Changing the look of the interface does nothing to address these problems , and despite the likelihood that the change is a reflection of the priorities of the developer, this is the kind of thing that keeps me from buying the app. You guys almost get there, but never quite."

I didn\'t have enough space left to download any of the new apps I wanted, and I couldn\'t email the video files elsewhere. This app removed that nightmare. Just copy to the sd ext card, and now I have ~900mb free. Still hard to believe there isn\'t any native functionality to do this, but in lieu of that, this app is a real life saver."

For more functions it is showing that three dotted button but not opening for me. So cannot do any other function on my files.  It was working fine till the last version. Developers, please resolve this asap and I kindly request you to reply me for this and suggest the solution."

I literally can\'t do now what I used the app for 90% of the time. Other functions that used to be top level are now hidden behind multiple drawer taps. Shame, looks like I\'m going to ES Explorer..."

  text: "Faster! But Lost Functionality\tDropped \342\230\205\342\230\205\'s.  New look is ok, but Astro no longer remembers where it was when you back out of a file.  This causes you to have to re-navigate back to the previous folder.  Needless PITA.      Also, understand the v4.4 SD Card write-permission issue is an Android problem, but Please continue to work to get Google to nix that ignorant measure.  Was really digging the app again until this latest update. Cheers!  \343\200\212S5 & Note 10.1\343\200\213"

Of you can go back to the design a couple updates so, then this is a keeper, if not then I\'m just going to have to uninstall updates and live with three same version for the rest of my tablet\'s life."

We are the beta test group. That\'s a good one. I keep sticking with Astro because I remember how simple and functional it once was and I have hope that that may come to pass again. It\'s sad though that I must have an alternate file manager always ready to go cause astro just isn\'t."

Before the update this app was great now it is really messed up!"

  text: "Why did ASTRO take my clouds away? And how do I get them back?\tI used to love this app, but the new version is terrible. My Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box locations suddenly disappeared, and I can\'t figure out how to get them back. In fact, I can\'t figure out how to add ANY locations (I also lost an ftp server). Adding locations used to be trivially easy but now the feature seems to be either hidden in some secondary menu or non-existent. For some reason ASTRO decided that my SkyDrive was cool, so I still have access to that one. Used to be five stars, but I have to downgrade to a generous two until I figure this one out (which I really shouldn\'t have to do)."

  text: "Used to love it, now harder to move files & I can\'t find my Dropbox!\tI really dislike the new interface. Previous versions had a very intuitive interface. I was able to easily add a link to my Dropbox account. In addition, the latest version also doesn\'t show icons (or a list) for common actions aside from copying & deleting. You now have to click on the \"more\" icon, to get a \"MOVE\" option. I do a LOT of file moving (downloads to final folders).   I hope this is fixed soon, or I will be looking for another file manager for my tablet & my phone."

I know it\'s hard to be considered \"relevant\" and \"bleeding edge\"...but how about giving your long-time supporters the option?  Just MY thoughts, anyway... so sad."

It cannot detect my network file share yet es file explorer (which i added manually) has no problems detecting it.   Going to metagos website to try and get support is worthless. Most of the forum is full of spam messages and seems that they have no actual moderators what so ever. Cant email the company directly for anything unless it is for sales. I have no idea why this app is so highly rated with such a huge glaring flaw"

Long-pressing on a file and tapping the \"more\" menu icon brought up nothing, which is why we wrote what we did in our reviews.    Visually, the new update is great. Functionally, it sucks. I can\'t move or rename my files anymore.  I liked the way the app was before."
