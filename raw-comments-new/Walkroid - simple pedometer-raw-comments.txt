I adjusted the step distance to 12.0 because I wasn\'t getting an accurate count of time nor distance. So now I\'m going to disable the battery saver and see what happens. Just read on someone else\'s review that it doesn\'t work when screen is off. So much for battery saving."

The mileage is off, though, but I\'ve calculated that it is off by half.  So I just double whatever it shows as mileage.  I\'m more concerned with counting of steps.  For that, it\'s terrific and am very happy with it."

Checking the battery stats showed that Walkdroid was using up the most juice. I like how it keeps a long record of step history, but unfortunately there is a delay before it actually counts steps. Usually this is a good feature, but my job requires a lot of walking but in short distances (I shelve books in a library), so this app is extremely inaccurate for me as most of my steps aren\'t recorded."

Then I got a Nexus 5 and Walkroid won\'t count my steps if the screen is off (turns out this is a common problem with pedometers on this phone). So I\'m sadly testing other pedometers. 5 stars for all the other phones I\'ve used it on, 0 stars for the Nexus 5 (even though it isn\'t the app\'s fault). Bye, Walkroid, I miss you already!"

Yes this thing still keeps track of every step and distance when the phone is in sleep, but hardly touches my battery power at all! I didn\'t talk on my phone, but sent 5 text, received 6, played on an app for my shopping list twice and wore it till 11pm....my phone was only at 85%. WOW! Very accurate with me counting my own steps. LOVE THIS THING! Yesterday over 3000 steps 1.25 miles, today 3,525 steps 2.5 miles....WOOOOHOOOOO Thanks for the hard work on this app!"

Found version 1.14 (over counting in vehicles) stopped it working - can\'t people simply use the stop option when they\'re not working out?  We\'re back on 1.13, via the settings -> how to use -> no adds -> 1.13 and we\'re back counting our steps on Walkroid!"

I tried so hard to trick it that I was taking a step by shaking it as many ways as I could and it only registered a few \"fake\" steps (another pedometer said over a hundred steps for the same movements). Still, I am hesitant on accuracy and wish it could do more but I am happier with this one than all the others i have tried."

But I will say that by using this app it is the most accurate that I\'ve seen so far that\'s free. The only thing that I wish is that the log work properly which it does not and that it had other features on it like a time that I\'ve been walking distance between walking and stopping in a few other little perks would be nice. Otherwise it\'s a great app!"

I suggest creating a notification that says \"Warning: Walkdroid has been running for <n> hours- open the app and press \"Stop\" if no longer needed\"  Allow the user to configure the limit from the app\'s setting screen.  Repeat warnings in this interval as long as it continues to run."

Mostly I don\'t think of it, then I have nice stats to look at when I do.  Recently however it has been killing my battery, it is 30% of CPU usage.  Not sure why, it didn\'t do that for months.  Not sure if there bas been a recent update."

I haven\'t tried it on an AOSP ROM (eg: CM9), only on the stock Samsung TouchWiz ROM."

Mine works in the background on the HTC rhyme so if yours doesn\'t then its your phone. My battery lasts about 10 hrs. It\'s nice you can\'t cheat it doesnt work if you shake it or you\'re in the car."

Note that this won\'t work on devices that shut off the accelerometer when the screen shuts off, as many do - if it doesn\'t work, it may be your device that\'s the problem. You also need to keep your device close to your body (hips/waist seem to be best) to get accurate numbers."

Would pay for a version with widget support and that shows calories burned as well. Love the dual odometer-like function. Hope you continue working on this app, it has a lot of potential. Thank you and keep up the great work!"

This one seemed like it until I looked more closley at what it was recording.  I go underground in the subways, and if the screen was active, and this app was up it would record fairly accurately how many steps I took, however if my screen went dark or if the program was not the active one up and in front on my screen it wouldn\'t count a single step.  I\'ve only had it a few hours but I\'m uninstalling it. :("

  text: "Not very accurate for Samsung Galaxy Nexus\tLove this App it works perfectly on the Galaxy S2. However when I changed to the Galaxy Nexus, the accuracy went out the window. The same distance that I used to walk (600 steps) which counted (and still counts) accurately on my Galaxy S2, registers less than 200 steps on my Galaxy Nexus. I wish there was some way I could calibrate the app for Galaxy Nexus, and I love how it just runs in the background keeping a daily counter of my steps."
