  text: "-HOLDING- the multitask button will act as a menu button press\tIf you have an android that no longer has a menu button, it should have a multitask button instead (the icon of overlapping rectangles).  Press and hold that button in the Blizzard mobile  authenticator app to bring up the settings.    NOTE: This works for any android app where you need to press a \"menu\" button to get at more of the settings."

I wasn\'t buying gold but apparently even browsing there websites are dangerous... Anyone who doesn\'t wanna have their accounts screwed over should definitely take the extra step here and use the authenticator. If you\'re worried about getting locked out from your account from a phone wipe (which I\'ve done before flashing ROM\'s) just simply setup SMS protection."

And since the Note 2 is broken, I can\'t use it to generate a code for me to log in to my account to remove the old authenticator code.  This app needs to be updated ASAP with a soft options menu."

Unfortunately,  the app menu button is not showing in the Galaxy S5 version of the app, so you cannot use your previous code and have to get Blizzard to disconnect authentication and you have to attach a new authenticator every time your phone dies (which happens to me a lot).  Meanwhile I have switched back to my old handheld authenicator until Blizzard fixes this bug."

Can you say Lame Sauce...  my old phone was a Nokia windows  phone and it gave me the option to switch between old and new devices with the very first serial number given to me so it would sync easy without having to deal with blizzard. Sadly the Samsung G S5 does not have this handy option. so if you have updated your phone and still want to play wow. You have to call support (good luck getting through) or submitting a ticket... I don\'t want to have to use my old phone when I have a perfectly good new one that has the app yet doesn\'t work..  might be good as a new client but a hassle for the old ones.. =("

So it is just hope that you can get it to come up from the area of the snyc button. It would be nice to have a settings button on the app itself so you can use it and not worry about the menu button."

  text: "Only one per account\tI wanted to attach a second copy, running on my tablet, to my account in case my phone wasn\'t working (although I have the reset codes securely stored by other methods). I was disappointed to see this wasn\'t possible except by copying over the reset code, which makes the two copies indistinguishable to Blizzard and means you can\'t detach one device that\'s lost or stolen and keep the other."

When using the home screen widget, it takes about 6-7+ seconds before a code will appear.  Not sure why it would take so much longer than the regular app does.  But other than that, it works great.  Just wish the widget was faster.  I would use the widget exclusively if it was just as fast as the app."

After that happened I got this app as fast as I could. While it\'s good to have an authenticator you still have to keep your computer virus free since keyloggers can now render your authenticator pretty much useless. And to the naysayers if you took the time to write down the serial number and the restore code you wouldn\'t be having the issues that you\'re having logging back in."

If you wish to use it on multiple devices (say a tablet and phone) you can use the serial number and restore code (you did write them down?) on the second device by using the restore option in the settings menu, enter the codes and you should have the same authentication code on both devices.  You are good to go."

It\'s called marriage dipshits, its not like you make it easy for us to change our information on the acct because trust me I\'ve tried. Seriously blizzard why do you have to make things so complicated?!"

As it is, it just sits there until the number pops up.  Also,  like someone else said,  separate the number with a dash in the middle for easier reading :-)"

The complaints state you lose your account and can\'t log into the game if you lose your phone or switch phones. That is not true all it takes is a simple call to Blizzard (like I did) or don\'t be a goofball (like I was) and forget to write the restore code and serial number down. If you have those two items from the last phone you can restore your authenticator without having to call. This app has never let me down"

It\'s very irritating and there\'s no way to get the authenticator off of your account unless you create a ticket... and the one time I did, they denied it. Ugh."

  text: "Fantastic for someone using a VPN.\tAs others have noted, the extra account security is great. However the single biggest reason I use it is because I\'m usually on a VPN whose IP changes very often. That\'s a suspicious account activity flag for Blizzard (and rightly so). If you\'re in a position like me, you can either constantly verify your account hasn\'t been hijacked by answering security questions, changing your password, and verifying your email address ad nauseum -- or you can take the extra 10 seconds to put in the code.  Like I said, I\'m happy Blizzard is on top of their game when it comes to tracking suspicious activity so I\'m definitely not complaining, but this makes the life of an SC2 player in my position much much easier."

  text: "Nice until you lose access\tI don\'t know which ridiculous policies Blizzard follows, but it is impossible to get your account back once you lose access to the authenticator. First: you can\'t even create a ticket without an account. And once you manage to do so anyway, they ask you for a scan of an ID. And because you can\'t respond to that ticket, you have to create another one, just to find out that all of your three IDs are not \'nationally accepted\' (not even an European passport). They don\'t even state why, and of course to ask you have to create a new ticket."

I have played the game for one day now the servers are down. This is extremely irritating, I buy the game so i can play it. I updated my gaming laptop to play this game and i cant even play it. Im questioning this companies integtrity."

This is the type of security people want and expect. Pay no attention to those who slander this app, they simply cannot abuse those of us with an authenticator!"

If you have two accounts and a Google Nexus 7 user, create a new local account on your app, redownload this, you now have 2 authenticators! Genius on Googles part :D"

  text: "Perfect, but one issue\tThis app works perfectly and does everything it claims to.  One issue, though, comes with removing it after formatting a phone or getting a new one. Even if one has SMS protection, it\'s hard to figure out just how to use said SMS to remove the authenticator conveniently. Even then, I\'d much rather prefer to just reset the authenticator to a new code if I can, rather than having to remove then re-add it.  Perhaps we could make new users more aware of this when downloading the app for the first time?"

With this added layer, someone would have to steal my physical keys to get my account... and if that happened, I\'d have much bigger things to worry about than my paladin."

And as GM of my guild I require all my officers to have it, it safe gaurds the guild bank and its assets. After being a victum to hackers, this has been one of the greatest additions to WoW. A few people mentioned it before, do not take it likely, save serial # and at least 2 codes from authenticator, will make replacing your device and keeping access to your account safe and easy to use."

Cool now. Moral of story. Do Not Deactivate It. Ever! Even with a mouse or here or there"
