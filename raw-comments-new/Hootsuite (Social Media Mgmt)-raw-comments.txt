The auto schedule feature is nice, but since it doesn\'t tell you what time the tweet will be scheduled for until you commit to tweeting it, and since there is no way to change the scheduled time once it\'s been committed, the only option is to delete the tweet. Needs to be fixed!"

Also free version has reduced from 5 social media account down to 3 only. If you always running around try to post into social media, this app won\'t give you much flexibility compare if you practice that on web version on computer."

The only problem I\'ve had is that it doesn\'t offer Google plus accounts in the app. I am thinking about going with Sprout Social instead so that I gain Google plus mobile support among other features not available with Hootsuite. I would like to stay with Hootsuite if they could offer the mobile features that are available elsewhere."

What I really dislike though is that it always runs in the background even fresh from reboot when you don\'t start it, and I\'m most concerned about it auto running even after applying a force stop to it. And dang...you sure ask for a lot of permissions, Hootsuite. Makes me miss Tweetdeck for Android."

BTW thanks for the reply. I dislike hoot suite on android be it phone/tablet. No match for seesmic plz. I just hate hoot suite on everything but PC. Even there it has limited use."

I pay netflix $12/month ($144/year) for four streams and I get WAY more use from Netflix than I would from Hootsuite. Do you honestly think your app provides as much usefulness as netflix? I don\'t see it."

Still wondering if there\'s an app which can manipulate the text - embedding links in a single word, underlining/italicizing, and so on. I\'m disappointed that the free version only allows for 3 accounts, but I can\'t hold it against them so much. My only real issue is with the Auto-Scheduling feature - Writing tweets in sequential order, I expected them to stay that way, and simply be sent. Nope"

  text: "Slightly improved but still a poorer relation of the Web version.\tHasn\'t really moved on that much in 3 years. Image sharing via Owly still as annoying. Stream data and FB profile image not syncing finally fixed. Lacks too much Twitter funcionality compared with other mobile clients. Most annoying issue is that even with images set to high quality, they still appear blurred. I\'m using Buffer predominantly."

Then this is a must have app...\tHootsuite mobile app is a simple, yet very powerful extension of your Hootsuite account. it\'s a snip to read, comment, share re-tweet and schedule your content whilst on the go. I find it especially useful at live events. Have a Hootsuite account and want to go mobile? Then download the app!"

It was also one of the first to cover all major mobile platforms. The functionality it offers on Android is very comprehensive when you consider all the social platforms you can manage through one application. Making indispensable as a mobile multi-client management application."

It loads the latest 51 tweets and you have to scroll down to the gap and load possibly sever times. Even this would be acceptable if it left you at the point where you left off, but no such luck, you have to scroll back and try and recognise your start point"

I feel like it\'s been out looking enough to get  some new enhancements instead of having to sync with buffer or social bro etc (not including App Net) which might be too much for some users."

  text: "Is not an effective extension of its namesake\tThe app is good enough at what it does but that is too limited to be really helpful.  The ONLY point of HootSuite is to be able to post to all your social networks from one place.  For some reason, this app leaves out Google+, while the regular service includes it.  On the face of it, this might seem minor but, given that I use the program to unify 3 social networks, I\'m losing 33% of it\'s unification value right out of the gate, before I even deal with the reasonable compromises that come from mobile."

While you\'re at it, if I tap a link in a tweet, I shouldn\'t have to open the tweet, click the link, read the linked article, then close the tweet before continuing."

Despite the cleaner look, all of the dead white space makes my feed noisier; tweets run together making it harder for me to quickly scan my feed. The scroll to top feature is sorely missed, as is the ability to customize my layout. I\'m also lukewarm on the auto display of a full convo; I just don\'t always care. It is true the app loads quicker, but at what cost?"

  text: "Great tool\tMuch of my social media activity revolves around using hootsuite and the app. I love that I can manage my primary social networks in one place. It\'s great for posting and auto scheduling content to reach followers and contacts. I do wish the app functioned more like the desktop to display multiple streams. I understand screen space would be a problem but it would be a real treat to have that experience on the app."

  text: "New update looks nicer, less useable\tPreviously thus app used to crash several times a day. At least it\'s more stable now but the new UI is so wasteful of space that you can only see a handful of tweets at a time. There doesn\'t seem to be any options to condense it into a more effective layout. Update - Recently has become virtually unusable as it freezes after a minute or two each time."

  text: "Not bad. Not great either.\tThis app desperately need the scheduling functionality of the web app so you can see your future tweets and ideally your past scheduled one\'s too. Without that functionality it is never going to be great. I also find it difficult to understand who has followed me but I\'m not following, which is again easiest on the web app. So, not bad but not great either."
