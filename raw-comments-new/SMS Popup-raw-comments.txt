Aside from the problem everyone has where the popup doesn\'t mark messages as read, it would spontaneously bring up a ton of old messages that it had already showed me days before and I would have to go through and close like ten notifications.    I know I had the settings correct between this app and hangouts regarding notifications so I\'m not really sure what else to do.  I\'ll be keeping an eye out for updates fixing any of these problems."

My Galaxy S4 still won\'t clear unread messages in the system tray, despite my having disabled the phone\'s internal messaging app notifications and I am only using the notifications for this app. They have to be cleared manually in order for them to show as read, and this is a very annoying problem. Also hate long messages being broken up."

  text: "Exactly what I was looking for\tThis app is perfect. It is small, simple, and elegant=no bloat. I wanted pop-up notifications and custom notification tones without having to download a giant, bloated text messaging app with features I would never use (e.g. Gosms, Handcent, Chompsms) That is exactly what I found with this fantastic app. No ads. No trivial extras.  Just small, fast, and perfect. Thanks for this app Adam K!"

These are the two main functions I was looking for and was told this app offered. I intend to try it again in the future to see if it\'s functioning improves, but for now it is an unnecessary replacement of the phone\'s native texting. Maybe next time!"

The first problem would be that it won\'t register if you read msgs from the pull down menu so when you do go to the main screen you\'re bombarded with old msgs and second is it won\'t by pass the lock screen so you have to open the lock thereby defeating the purpose of a quick reply. I\'d be willing to pay for a fixed version."

  text: "I really love this app... but\tI really love this app and I have been using it for a long time.  I desperately wish there was a way to clear all notifications.  I use MightyText to text from my laptop when I\'m at work, and at the end of the day I have to clear over a hundred notifications for texts I already responded to on another device.  It would be nice to simply long press the close button and have all of the notifications cleared.  Instead I sit in traffic and press the close button incessantly.  Minus 2 stars for this, will update review to five if change is implemented."

  text: "Needs improving\tI love the idea of this app, it should be integrated into the messaging app. However, often times it indicates a message is unread even after I view it. I did follow directions and disable notifications on default message app but when this glitch happens I\'m forced to either restart my phone or delete the most recent message. Fix this error for 5 stars.         UPDATE:  Will be removing from phone now as this is too frustrating."

This way you can dock the message until you are ready to respond. Otherwise the app is great. I have used others similar, and there is usually some sort of functionality issue.... Like not working with mms, or taking to long to respond to a message."

The pop up message was an added bonus and I love the text to speech feature. Only a few minor suggestions to make it better. I would like to see the lock screen in the background when it wakes up my screen. Also it\'s kind of annoying that closing the pop up or using quick reply doesn\'t mark the message as read. The LED doesn\'t work on my phone, but that\'s definitely not a deal breaker. Good work!"

One minor big I noticed is that sometimes there would be a notification with blank text, but it maybe phone/carrier issue (I suspect it may have happened to MMS with pictures when they were still downloading)."

Rather than having to stop what I\'m doing, flip to my messages, reply, then go back to what I was doing, I just use the quick reply feature. It is very handy. The only change I would suggest, is to make the SMS notification disappear from the top of my screen if I quick reply to it (unless that is already a setting, and I just missed it.) If that change was made, this would be 5 stars for sure. Edit: Found the option. 5 stars!"

  text: "Pretty darn good\tThis app is exactly what I was looking for. I didn\'t want a third party app replacing my standard text messaging app, just one that created a popup to send a quick reply and it works well with Google Now. And being able to swipe through unread messages is a really neat feature. I would give the app 5 stars if the message was marked read after replying from the popup window and if the popup color could be customized."

  text: "works great most of the time\tBut it doesn\'t not handle pictures or group conversations very well. A thumbnail preview of pictures would be perfect. Not as big a deal as what it does with group conversations. It really doesn\'t know what to do with those. Instead taking me to the group conversation, it takes me to the previous individual conversation, and not to the new group conversation post. :(  Still, for individual conversations, it really is great. Which is was a standard part of Android, just better with MMS."

Whenever I use it and messages come in, I can NOT get the number beside the phones SMS app (that shows number of messages received) to go away! I\'ve tried everything, too include even deleting the SMS thread that came thru.  All with no luck.  Only thing that works is rebooting the phone.  So sad for an app as good as this."

  text: "Great idea executed poorly.\tThis was the only way to get a pop up message on my KitKat powered Nexus 5. Unfortunately, messages repeat sometimes, and sometimes pop up hours after they were originally sent and in the message box on the phone. No way to view conversation inside SMS popup either. The only plus was the annoying and persistent way you could set it up so no messages would go unnoticed. Unfortunately, it just does not work well enough to keep. Maybe I will find a better app similar to the idea of this one."

Maybe a little themes like holo style or iOS7 (white). Change \342\200\234Inbox to Open\342\200\235 in button notification setting. Also, make the Contact Image in popup notification smaller. Make it rounded square or an image of an Android (the old one). Thanks"

I read messages, or delete them on the app and my phone still says I have messages, the notification bar still says I have messages, but there are no new messages. Open my messages, view them (again) and phone still tells me I have messages.  If this app worked with the phone rather than on its own rules it would have been great, as it is its just not viable.... such a shame, get it sorted and let me know and I will gladly re-install it."

Now every time I get a text, I\'m going to have to turn on the phone and go into my messages?  That\'s kind of the point of using this - so I wouldn\'t have to do that."

  text: "Excellent App but has few tiny niggles\tI am using it on my Gionee Pioneer P2 on Jelly Bean 4.2.2. It runs great and shows the messages. But after the message is replied to from the popup, it registers as a message that could not sent successfully in the stock messaging app.  upon opening which I am notified of messages not sent and they have the Repeat option below them.  Also for some reason my contact photos are not displayed on the popup, which I feel maybe due to the fact that my contact photos are of high resolution updated via Sync.ME. Even though these are not big bugs please look into resolving them."

It can take a little experimentation, but the way this app handles custom vibration patterns (entered as a string of off/on durations) allows for precise timing -- which you can use to set up distinctive musical (rhythmic) notifications that are more subtle than using a song itself as a ringtone.   I don\'t use many of the app\'s other features, but they look similarly elegant."

All it does is turn the screen on and place a notification in the top. I prefer the old way of seeing the message on the screen.  Otherwise a great little utility."

The only thing that I can\'t understand and  don\'t like in this app when u get a text the standard Samsung message application still shows the text as not  read. If u could show me a way to fix it that would be cool.  Also maybe way to customize the pop up would be cool too. Thanks"

Especially for TW users, but it has one little issue(which took off one star): every time I receive a text, the notification count on the system SMS app icon stays on(red) even after I actually read the message. Isn\'t it supposed to go away after I read the message? Other than that, the app is really nice. Edit: had to uninstall. Beside the annoying remaining number on the messaging app, it receives empty lines from people who text me sometimes."

This means that every time my phone reboots, the last 10 or so people I\'ve Quick Replied to get another copy of the SMS\'s in question. People get very confused because they\'re getting messages at all hours, completely out of context. If this is a known problem and there is a fix available, I\'ll gladly change my rating! Love everything else about the app."

Thats why its not 5 stars. also, if you were to go into to messaging app and delete all the new messages, it still pops up with all the old, already deleted texts. the only work around is to disable then re/enable the app."

Always Use Privacy Mode/\"Only use privacy mode when screen is locked\" - this option doesn\'t work, privacy mode is always on whether phone is locked or not. Replying to a message doesn\'t mark the message as read - (if this is not a bug) should this not be the default or at least an option? Looking forward to the update that has these features working and will gratefully donate."

Love the functionality, love the options for customization, but with my new Note 3, I can\'t get the notification light to flash, no matter what color I set it to. It also won\'t clear the message notification from the \"reply\" button, I have to back out of the conversation and open the text like I didn\'t have the app installed at all. I love the app itself, but it\'s a little clunky on this phone in particular."

Also even-though the app description says \"NOTE: SMS Popup does mark message as \'read\'...\" You can still uncheck this option and have the close button keep the message unread. Many people like to keep the message unread so they don\'t forget it later or for other reasons. The dev should change the description to say that as this turned off a friend of mine who was too lazy to download and try it and simply went by the app info. Keep up the great work and everyone should donate to keep this great app updated!"

  text: "Brilliant but needs tweaks\tLove this app, would have rated 5 star but I feel it needs 2 main tweaks. 1) Disable popups when locked. Basically if the phone is locked and you get a text and use the swipe message shortcut it tries to show you a popup in between doing that and the app opening. No big deal but very annoying. Also the ability to change button order is ace, can we have that on the popup? After composing a text I\'d love the send button on the left, I\'m left handed, everyone always forgets us :-("

The S4/TouchWiz has issues with popping up on the lock screen, and marking messages as read when pressing close. This is the first time I\'ve had major issues.  A minor bug: Notification doesn\'t always show. Sometimes have to unlock phone and see pop up to know I got a message."

There is no way for me to hear my text tone with them on.  The ability to set a custom icon for a text notification is great. So I turned off the native text notifications and started using this apps for my text notifications.  +1 to all the other great features this app offers for free (in need of a serious bold and underline) :) Thank you for this app."

Having the default system notification enabled (admittedly against the app developer\'s advice) results in minor inconvenience of two notifications on message receipt. Have submitted bug/enhancement requests."

It says I have two unread text messages in my notification bar even when I don\'t have any unread messages. I tried deleting all my conversations and still it says \"2 Unread Messages\". It has become quite the inconvenience to me because I like the preview in my notifications bar so I don\'t always have to read the message if I\'m busy and I really hard popups on my home screen. I tried clearing the data from the app, still there."

The only thing that really bugs me is when you tap the \"Inbox\" button on the Quick Reply screen.  Instead of it taking you into that particular conversation, it will take you into the last conversation that you were in in the stock messaging app.  I am not sure if this is a bug in the SMS Popup app or the stock messaging app.  I will continue to use the app as this is just a minor annoyance to me, but others should be careful that they don\'t send a message to the wrong person thinking they were taken into the desired conversation.  I will give it three stars for now and a full 5 upon this being resolved."

  text: "Please fix for GS4\tI gave it a five star review for my Cliq and my GS2. I love this app and have been using it for years. However, there are some issues with it in regards to the Galaxy 4. Notifications on the text icon don\'t disappear even after I\'ve read the texts or pressed \"close\". Also, the message does NOT show up on the lock screen. That perk was one of the main reasons I loved this app so much. Please fix the bugs and I will put back my five star review. Thanks!"

Mark as read is clicked on and the original message notifications are off.  Yet all messages that I read and closed still pops up unless I individually go in them.  This is very very annoying as messages keeps popping up."
