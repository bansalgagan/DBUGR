  text: "Was good but now broken and near useless.\tRecording tracks still works, but you can\'t now paly it in Google Earth (even though the play button is still there). Press it and it takes you to Google Earth and nothing happens.  How stupid is that?  Take a great feature, stop it working, but leave the button that launches it.  Dumb.  Useless to me now."

If so, I would like to see integration of any SMART Bluetooth 4.0 HR sensor, not just those from zephyr or polar (read $$$). It\'s a good, bare bones app that does it\'s job, but since I can\'t measure my HR over time, I have no choice but to use Endomondo. I don\'t get it. If all these 3rd party apps pick up other hr monitors as well, google can definitely add that functionality."

You find out it that it helps you in ways you didn\'t even know about. Well, removing the feature that allows this app to share data within your phone with other apps, this is going the wrong direction. My Tracks has become useless."

  text: "Love hate relationship\tI wish Google would decide if they want to support this app or not.  It\'s a great running app and the export capability is great, but they didn\'t have any significant support for so long that it was left to others like pebble to innovate workable uses for it.  They seemed to encourage it but then they do things like remove app sharing and exclude those very third party supporters.  I wish I could like it again."

BUT it consistently USES OVER 40% of the CPU when I am NOT USING THE APP.  And there has been no update recently that fixes this problem.  Actually, I think the last update made it worse.  Go a Google search, \"my tracks battery,\" to read all the consternation over this issue."

I just updated to the new version and tried again and still GPS is way out. It\'s not a patch on the free Polar app. Both apps can be paired with my Polar Bluetooth H7 HRM. The Polar is also not as accurate as my Garmin GPS, but it is usually out by less than 0.5km over a 12km run."

I liked the ability to insert pictures and markers, however, the process was quite buggy and CPU intensive.  Even though there was a GPS signal and I could see my exact spot on the map, at times the markers would not input because it said there was no GPS signal.    I hope google streamlines this and improves the CPU draw and fixes the bugginess of inserting markers and pictures."

So much for \"Do no evil\" Google."

Last feature completely removed sharing with other apps (that was already crippled in previous updates now gone) and external control via API for 3rd party apps. I am not happy with direction this app continues to devolve. Not to mention that now track quality is worse than Endomondo working in parallel... Shame on you, Google for breaking good app."

As such, I tend not to trust Google, for issues separate from its data collection, because just like Charlie Brown, I think, \'Oh, no ... not again!\' each time I see Google with a football."

Never freezed or caused any problems. The only thing missing would be the ability to edit your track, like remove parts of the track/map after it\'s done; maybe by integration with mymaps (on google maps) editing."

This, however, was terrible. Every time you switched to another part of the app, your location on the map would be lost. Additionally, it is impossible (as far as I could tell) to add markers. I can\'t even test the app to see if it functions properly. I don\'t know anything about the history of this app, but I\'d guess it hasn\'t been significantly modified in 2+ years"

  text: "Not even accurate enough to be useful\tI used this app and it showed me all over the place. It kept losing its signal and showed me walking through buildings and through the middle of the blocks, back tracking at least three times (which I did not do)  and it wasn\'t even close to where I was for about 50 percent of the time. This app may be good for a little bit of fun but don\'t even think of relying on it for any kind of accurate tracking of exercise, distance traveled or routes taken because it will give you results that are nowhere close to what you actually did. I am thoroughly disappointed but not surprised."

Also should be able to view multiple routes on the map at once."

It picks up the GPS signal quickly and actually doesn\'t loose it and it\'s nice to know how far I walk and cycle, how many calories I approx burn and then to play it back on Google Earth is just cool."

It was all a giant dotted line recording 4 of the 9 miles I walked. The app constantly said it was waiting for a better GPS signal and I noticed that the GPS signal in the dashboard was only on for a few seconds at a time.  I used map my run in the same scenario and it never missed a single step and tracked my route more accurately."

Only recording half of where you run. Makes your speed and distance totally out. Very frustrating. Today\'s 4k run came out at 2.5k over the same length of time, so it looks kind of slow..."

  text: "Lots of options/features -- Interface a bit sparse & crowded\tI\'ve read negative comments about this app that simply aren\'t true:  1) The app displays stats, charts, or a map with your trace (this is the default) while it\'s recording.  2) It\'s easy to sync GPS before you start recording: press the \"location\" cross hairs at the top of the screen to start/stop GPS use.  You don\'t have to kill your battery powering GPS when you just want to look at or export your recent data.  3) Tweaking settings for line segment length, GPS recording accuracy, time/distance between recorded location points, etc can drastically improve CPU use and GPS accuracy.  There are *far* more options than the typical tracking app.  After tweaks, I get smoother, more accurate recorded traces than with other apps.  Also, there is an option to automatically sync data to Google Drive. -- Also nice --  There are several features & export options only available with paid versions of other tracking apps.  -- A minor issue is the interface -- a bit sparse and crowded, but serviceable.  It\'s sometimes easy to accidentally select things you didn\'t intend."

I have other compass apps which gives my current lat longs.. But I wanted everything on the same deck.. The stats are available only after the end of recording.. If I could see my current elevation, lat longs.. While recording is in progress.. That wud b great!"

  text: "Not sure how accurate...\tI\'ve tried My Tracks from Google and an app called MapMyWalk, both on my Nexus 7 w/Kit Kat.  Over the exact same route, there is a 0.09 mile difference between the two**, as well as calories burned (but calories burned is only a guesstimate IMO, as everyone has different body compositions and metabolisms).  What I like about My Tracks is that it stores locally and I can send to my choice of Docs, Sheets, or GME.   I can then choose what kind of info I\'d like to share and who I\'d like to share it with.  Can\'t say the same for some of the other trackers out there...  **Update: Having tried a few other apps and even using web based mapping tools from Google, Bing, and Yahoo, My Tracks is more accurate logging distance than MapMyWalk is.  Edit to add:  If this app had a calendar view or exported to Google Calendar with the activity type, duration, and calorie burned info, I would not hesitate to stop using other apps/services."

  text: "Moving time vs. total time\tIt doesn\'t take short stops into account when calculating \"moving time\". This adds up quickly when hitting multiple stop lights on even a short commute. It should take all stops into account, not just stops over a minute.  This morning my moving time in the app was only 45 seconds shorter than total time over a 30 minute drive, but my actual moving time was 2 minutes 40 seconds less according to GPS."

I\'ve tried a ton of other apps, that are not bad, but this one is definitely a milestone away. It\'s very easy to use, it\'s fast, you don\'t have to go through tons of settings, you just hit the button and off it goes. The saved data is very accurate, something I haven\'t experienced on any other app."

My only suggestion is that my tracks learns some of your common tracks and then when you cannot get GPS signal it can still calculate approximate measurements for your run or similar upon completion."

Currently it is either a single track or all teh tracks ....  (3) Merge multiple tracks together. This would help on tracks with imporatnt pause or when \"Stop\" is pushed by mistake."

  text: "Good but can be improved.\tInstalled it on my 2013 moto g. Only used it one time to track my road cycling. GPS accuracy is pretty spot on with only minor deviation. Didn\'t have anything else for me to compare stats like speed and elevations with so I can\'t be sure of its accuracy. My only gripe, I can\'t share my track on Facebook!"

  text: "Accuracy\tI used the recommended accuracy setting for the first use. The end result was a track that looked like I drank heavily prior to walking the dogs. The track didn\'t even show correctly on satellite view. About 30 yards off. The second use I upped the accuracy settings. The resulting track was moderately better but a huge chunk was missing.  The actual distance was 3.4 miles but the app said it was 1.8 miles. I didn\'t expect it to be as accurate as my handheld GPS but I also didn\'t expect it to be wildly off."

  text: "Love the app, hate the inconsistancy\tMoved over to this app because it will sync with multiple Ant+ devices at the same time. This allows me to record my stride and heart rate. With that said, the experience is very inconsistent. Sometimes everything connects, sometimes it does not.  I absolutely love the map and fly by in google earth, very cool. Would love to see the ability to resume a started track, and maybe a function to make sure the monitors are connected prior to starting a new track. Currently the sensors only connect once a track has been started."

  text: "Max speed is worng..recorded path deviated\tI\'m quite old user of this app but its performance going worse update by update.. app developer should have to set the priority for its accurate performance first and basic accurate calculations. Take too much time to get gps signals when it get connected there is no guarantee to have a accuracy in  recorded path. Without accuracy in recording path all calculations looks messy. There should be a possibility to use offline maps. Is Google really a best developer? a question mark in presence of local apps."

Failed to record any data after 10 minutes.  Needs to be fixed!!"

That gives me a nice accurate map of what I\'ve done, but I can\'t see the stats - time, speed etc.  Do I actually have to export the tracks to get at that data? Why isn\'t that being synced as well?  Low rating because of that - even if it is possible, it\'s certainly not intuitive."

  text: "Quite good - suggestion to reduce artifacts\tOne problem is the speed dropping to zero at intervals - creating spike artifacts in the chart. An easy solution is to allow the option of taking the median (not average) of the readings each side of the reading. This allows trends to be unaffected, but spikes to be neatly removed. An option to \"smooth\" or \"remove spikes\" would be appreciated. The stronger the smoothing, the more readings each side would be used. Stopping for a while would be properly recorded. (I use this approach to increase signal to noise and reduce detection limits in signal processing)"

Include an option to resume a track recording at any later date, needed also as the auto-resume recording after phone reboot option does not work reliably.  2. Option to initiate GPS fix when opening the app, as in some situations and countries this can take 10-20 minutes for first fix.  3. Detect tunnels and include distance in trip total (Countries like Japan and Italy have lots in certain regions and so trip distances can be way off)"

It would be nice to get directions of a new complex route on a workout while traking/logging what you have done. Please please do this Google!"

  text: "Incorrect and reduced stats with new maps engine\tI am using this app for quite few hikes from last year. This app consistently shows incorrect stats during hikes. Reduced distance and high elevation gain. e.g when I went to a hike with official distance of 6 miles, this app showed only 5.32 miles. It spikes the elevation gain crazily. This app shows elevation gain of 4500+ feet for a hike with official elevation gain of 3500 feet.  One thing I used to like about this app is the amount of statistics and graphs provided when I upload to google maps. After the maps engine update, the stats are removed.   Time to look for another app."

  text: "Problems negate utility\tGoogle does not use their good programmers on this one. When I first downloaded it, it worked very well. Then an upgrade broke it and it gave  ridiculous numbers. Then they fixed that, but now it cuts off constantly, goes to the save screen, and does not let you resume a walk. I had it stop five times today on two walks, which pretty much destroys any attempt to actually track your walking."

Return to this app and it is still searching. Last time it took over five minutes to locate my position, this took some of the enjoyment out of using this app. Will continue to use this to see if it improves. 3/5."

The post-workout map recording is neat but a bit of a gimmick and I doubt many would rewatch it. I had no issues with the GPS signals as others have reported.   I would like see support for bluetooth health trackers such as the Fitbit be added to the app."

  text: "Pretty decent app for getting KML files of a hike\tThis app used to have problems recording over a certain number of miles in a single track (~3 miles?) not sure if this still exists since I haven\'t had to track that long lately. Hopefully if that still exists, that limitation goes away in future versions. An option to pick up an older track at a future date would be nice, especially if the phone needs a reboot or you revisit somewhere you went before and pick up where you left off. Great to help make your own custom google maps with tracks"

I circle around and repeat several  streets.  If you measure the road length without repeats, 2.34 sounds right.  Another app, Track My Walk, gets the distance right,  but drains battery because it never turns off. I\'ll keep looking."

  text: "Latest update really messed up a find app\tBefore I would have given this app a 4.  Since the latest update, the gps drops segments 20% of the time on routes that I have carefully calibrated.  That makes mileage and speed stats are off.  Also the calorie calculator gives results significantly lower than other apps (534 vs. 1890).  THAT IS A HUGH DIFFERENCE.  The higher value is the low value from four other apps (range 1890 to 2180).  Please fix the problems to make this at least a 4 again."

I assume/hope that this is meant to refer to Zephyr/Polar-like sensors, i.e. Bluetooth 2.1 and Bluetooth 4.0 in general, but this isn\'t clear from any documentation available and until it is, I am unable to invest in accessories.  I\'d be very grateful if anyone has further info on sensor compatibility..."

Thanks, great app!"

Secondly the moving time doesn\'t work anymore. The moving time clock pauses when you stop moving but when nyou resume it just catches up with the total time clock."

  text: "This app must think I\'m drunk!\tThis app would be great except for a MAJOR problem that makes it useless. The GPS precision when using this app is awful. I can be standing perfectly still when I start tracking and my locatio jumps around like a drunk kangaroo. The tracker then registers a couple of hundred meters of travel in a few seconds, which makes the other stats on the phone meaningless. Other GPS applications on my phone do NOT do this, just this one, so its most likely app related. Come on Google, you\'re better than this!"

Two moans - one is that the elevation stats are only as good as the maps and their elevation data! For example, I live close to the sea and often take a cycle tour along by the seafront - it should be giving me 3-4M of altitude and not 60M!  The other - the calorie burning data doesn\'t seem correct either."

I\'ve hiked up mountains with zero signals, other than GPS, and the map filled itself in later when I returned to the city.  If your phone can\'t acquire GPS directly, you\'ll need a signal from the phone towers.  This app works just fine, anywhere, in any conditions.  You\'re phone just needs to have the proper hardware."

They seemed to encourage it but then they do things like remove app sharing and exclude those very third party supporters.  I wish I could like it again."

  text: "GPS not accurate\tI tried this app earlier in the year on my Nexus 5 and it was inaccurate. (I wore my Garmin Forerunner to compare). I just updated to the new version and tried again and still GPS is way out. It\'s not a patch on the free Polar app. Both apps can be paired with my Polar Bluetooth H7 HRM. The Polar is also not as accurate as my Garmin GPS, but it is usually out by less than 0.5km over a 12km run."

I liked the ability to insert pictures and markers, however, the process was quite buggy and CPU intensive.  Even though there was a GPS signal and I could see my exact spot on the map, at times the markers would not input because it said there was no GPS signal.    I hope google streamlines this and improves the CPU draw and fixes the bugginess of inserting markers and pictures."

The fact that Google disabled 3rd party support does not persuade me to try Android Wear. I used the Tasker plug-in to record my mileage and route for my job. I also used the Pebble My Tracks app for my workouts, because it showed more info than other apps."

I won\'t be buying anything Android Wear, partly on principle and partly because the Pebble is a better device."

Also handy if you get lost and need to backtrack. It doesn\'t require data which is nice. I record and then when back in data range...can view map overlay. Good tool for phone or tablet."

  text: "Removed sharing with other apps\tOne thing Google consistently excels at is causing needless frustration for its users either by forcing undesirable features upon the community or, in a manner just as unintuitive to user experience, forcing from the community features that made apps such as My Tracks more fun and functional. As such, I tend not to trust Google, for issues separate from its data collection, because just like Charlie Brown, I think, \'Oh, no ... not again!\' each time I see Google with a football."

Never freezed or caused any problems. The only thing missing would be the ability to edit your track, like remove parts of the track/map after it\'s done; maybe by integration with mymaps (on google maps) editing."

This, however, was terrible. Every time you switched to another part of the app, your location on the map would be lost. Additionally, it is impossible (as far as I could tell) to add markers. I can\'t even test the app to see if it functions properly. I don\'t know anything about the history of this app, but I\'d guess it hasn\'t been significantly modified in 2+ years"

It kept losing its signal and showed me walking through buildings and through the middle of the blocks, back tracking at least three times (which I did not do)  and it wasn\'t even close to where I was for about 50 percent of the time. This app may be good for a little bit of fun but don\'t even think of relying on it for any kind of accurate tracking of exercise, distance traveled or routes taken because it will give you results that are nowhere close to what you actually did. I am thoroughly disappointed but not surprised."

It was all a giant dotted line recording 4 of the 9 miles I walked. The app constantly said it was waiting for a better GPS signal and I noticed that the GPS signal in the dashboard was only on for a few seconds at a time.  I used map my run in the same scenario and it never missed a single step and tracked my route more accurately."

  text: "It\'s good, but used to be better.\tWould give it a 5 if the gp\'s tracking works properly like it used to. Unfortunately recent updates have meant the gp\'s tracking is intermittent. Only recording half of where you run. Makes your speed and distance totally out. Very frustrating. Today\'s 4k run came out at 2.5k over the same length of time, so it looks kind of slow..."

Anyway, it does let you export your track in different formats and this is great, actually the hole point for me. .... and the mark feature is really nice as well. What is missing big time from Google is a way to publicly share and search for interesting tracks online and import them of course."

  text: "Lots of options/features -- Interface a bit sparse & crowded\tI\'ve read negative comments about this app that simply aren\'t true:  1) The app displays stats, charts, or a map with your trace (this is the default) while it\'s recording.  2) It\'s easy to sync GPS before you start recording: press the \"location\" cross hairs at the top of the screen to start/stop GPS use.  You don\'t have to kill your battery powering GPS when you just want to look at or export your recent data.  3) Tweaking settings for line segment length, GPS recording accuracy, time/distance between recorded location points, etc can drastically improve CPU use and GPS accuracy.  There are *far* more options than the typical tracking app.  After tweaks, I get smoother, more accurate recorded traces than with other apps.  Also, there is an option to automatically sync data to Google Drive. -- Also nice --  There are several features & export options only available with paid versions of other tracking apps.  -- A minor issue is the interface -- a bit sparse and crowded, but serviceable.  It\'s sometimes easy to accidentally select things you didn\'t intend."

I have other compass apps which gives my current lat longs.. But I wanted everything on the same deck.. The stats are available only after the end of recording.. If I could see my current elevation, lat longs.. While recording is in progress.. That wud b great!"

  text: "Not sure how accurate...\tI\'ve tried My Tracks from Google and an app called MapMyWalk, both on my Nexus 7 w/Kit Kat.  Over the exact same route, there is a 0.09 mile difference between the two**, as well as calories burned (but calories burned is only a guesstimate IMO, as everyone has different body compositions and metabolisms).  What I like about My Tracks is that it stores locally and I can send to my choice of Docs, Sheets, or GME.   I can then choose what kind of info I\'d like to share and who I\'d like to share it with.  Can\'t say the same for some of the other trackers out there...  **Update: Having tried a few other apps and even using web based mapping tools from Google, Bing, and Yahoo, My Tracks is more accurate logging distance than MapMyWalk is.  Edit to add:  If this app had a calendar view or exported to Google Calendar with the activity type, duration, and calorie burned info, I would not hesitate to stop using other apps/services."

My only suggestion is that my tracks learns some of your common tracks and then when you cannot get GPS signal it can still calculate approximate measurements for your run or similar upon completion."

Too often I come to touch teh \"Stop\" button by mistake ... and can resume .... (2) Another feature needed is the multi-selection export. Currently it is either a single track or all teh tracks ....  (3) Merge multiple tracks together. This would help on tracks with imporatnt pause or when \"Stop\" is pushed by mistake."

The track didn\'t even show correctly on satellite view. About 30 yards off. The second use I upped the accuracy settings. The resulting track was moderately better but a huge chunk was missing.  The actual distance was 3.4 miles but the app said it was 1.8 miles. I didn\'t expect it to be as accurate as my handheld GPS but I also didn\'t expect it to be wildly off."

  text: "Love the app, hate the inconsistancy\tMoved over to this app because it will sync with multiple Ant+ devices at the same time. This allows me to record my stride and heart rate. With that said, the experience is very inconsistent. Sometimes everything connects, sometimes it does not.  I absolutely love the map and fly by in google earth, very cool. Would love to see the ability to resume a started track, and maybe a function to make sure the monitors are connected prior to starting a new track. Currently the sensors only connect once a track has been started."

Take too much time to get gps signals when it get connected there is no guarantee to have a accuracy in  recorded path. Without accuracy in recording path all calculations looks messy. There should be a possibility to use offline maps. Is Google really a best developer? a question mark in presence of local apps."

Failed to record any data after 10 minutes.  Needs to be fixed!!"

Why isn\'t that being synced as well?  Low rating because of that - even if it is possible, it\'s certainly not intuitive."

  text: "Quite good - suggestion to reduce artifacts\tOne problem is the speed dropping to zero at intervals - creating spike artifacts in the chart. An easy solution is to allow the option of taking the median (not average) of the readings each side of the reading. This allows trends to be unaffected, but spikes to be neatly removed. An option to \"smooth\" or \"remove spikes\" would be appreciated. The stronger the smoothing, the more readings each side would be used. Stopping for a while would be properly recorded. (I use this approach to increase signal to noise and reduce detection limits in signal processing)"

Include an option to resume a track recording at any later date, needed also as the auto-resume recording after phone reboot option does not work reliably.  2. Option to initiate GPS fix when opening the app, as in some situations and countries this can take 10-20 minutes for first fix.  3. Detect tunnels and include distance in trip total (Countries like Japan and Italy have lots in certain regions and so trip distances can be way off)"

It loses satellite constantly and records erratic traces. Try sportstrackerlive instead. Update: it\'s really screwed up now. Keeps duplicating tracks in the list!"

  text: "Incorrect and reduced stats with new maps engine\tI am using this app for quite few hikes from last year. This app consistently shows incorrect stats during hikes. Reduced distance and high elevation gain. e.g when I went to a hike with official distance of 6 miles, this app showed only 5.32 miles. It spikes the elevation gain crazily. This app shows elevation gain of 4500+ feet for a hike with official elevation gain of 3500 feet.  One thing I used to like about this app is the amount of statistics and graphs provided when I upload to google maps. After the maps engine update, the stats are removed.   Time to look for another app."

Then they fixed that, but now it cuts off constantly, goes to the save screen, and does not let you resume a walk. I had it stop five times today on two walks, which pretty much destroys any attempt to actually track your walking."

Saved our bacon twice when comparing to our map to learn we weren\'t quite where we thought we were. Thank you for a great app."

Return to this app and it is still searching. Last time it took over five minutes to locate my position, this took some of the enjoyment out of using this app. Will continue to use this to see if it improves. 3/5."

The post-workout map recording is neat but a bit of a gimmick and I doubt many would rewatch it. I had no issues with the GPS signals as others have reported.   I would like see support for bluetooth health trackers such as the Fitbit be added to the app."

  text: "Pretty decent app for getting KML files of a hike\tThis app used to have problems recording over a certain number of miles in a single track (~3 miles?) not sure if this still exists since I haven\'t had to track that long lately. Hopefully if that still exists, that limitation goes away in future versions. An option to pick up an older track at a future date would be nice, especially if the phone needs a reboot or you revisit somewhere you went before and pick up where you left off. Great to help make your own custom google maps with tracks"

I circle around and repeat several  streets.  If you measure the road length without repeats, 2.34 sounds right.  Another app, Track My Walk, gets the distance right,  but drains battery because it never turns off. I\'ll keep looking."

  text: "Latest update really messed up a find app\tBefore I would have given this app a 4.  Since the latest update, the gps drops segments 20% of the time on routes that I have carefully calibrated.  That makes mileage and speed stats are off.  Also the calorie calculator gives results significantly lower than other apps (534 vs. 1890).  THAT IS A HUGH DIFFERENCE.  The higher value is the low value from four other apps (range 1890 to 2180).  Please fix the problems to make this at least a 4 again."

However, there is nowhere on the web where I can find an exhaustive, or even semi-comprehensive list of compatible Bluetooth sensors.  The app itself makes reference only to \"Zephyr HxM Bluetooth [and] Polar WearLink Bluetooth.    I assume/hope that this is meant to refer to Zephyr/Polar-like sensors, i.e. Bluetooth 2.1 and Bluetooth 4.0 in general, but this isn\'t clear from any documentation available and until it is, I am unable to invest in accessories.  I\'d be very grateful if anyone has further info on sensor compatibility..."

Works nicely, but I\'m missing two things: 1) store and display the real (absolute) time in the chart, not just the relative time since the start of the recording, 2) milestones should be stored the moment I push the button, not after I fill in the details and tap OK; in fact, that should be optional. Thanks, great app!"

I can be standing perfectly still when I start tracking and my locatio jumps around like a drunk kangaroo. The tracker then registers a couple of hundred meters of travel in a few seconds, which makes the other stats on the phone meaningless. Other GPS applications on my phone do NOT do this, just this one, so its most likely app related. Come on Google, you\'re better than this!"

  text: "Great fitness tool\tI use it on a Samsung S4 Mini - it works great and is a really useful fitness tracker. Two moans - one is that the elevation stats are only as good as the maps and their elevation data! For example, I live close to the sea and often take a cycle tour along by the seafront - it should be giving me 3-4M of altitude and not 60M!  The other - the calorie burning data doesn\'t seem correct either."

The app itself has to be able to recognize this hrm (the addidas running app integrates this functionality nicely)."

I\'ve hiked up mountains with zero signals, other than GPS, and the map filled itself in later when I returned to the city.  If your phone can\'t acquire GPS directly, you\'ll need a signal from the phone towers.  This app works just fine, anywhere, in any conditions.  You\'re phone just needs to have the proper hardware."
